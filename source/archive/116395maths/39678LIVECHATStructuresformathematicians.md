### [LIVE CHAT: Structures for mathematicians](39678LIVECHATStructuresformathematicians.html)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 19:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127264270):
At 8pm UK time (2000 BST, so 1900 GMT) I am going to a live Lean explanation, in this thread, of a very simple mathlib file which defines a (non-inductive) structure. Mathematicians need to learn how to make structures, it's something we do very differently in mathematics. Here we need a far more formal kind of interface. I will hopefully do a few of these. It's like "talking people through mathlib files".

youtube live?

#### [Johan Commelin (May 29 2018 at 20:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127264635):
No, it seems "Zulip live"

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 20:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127265656):
Johan, I was inspired to do it after looking at the structure you constructed, which reminded me of the terrible first structure I constructed.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267673):
Hello, this is just me talking through `pnat.lean`

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267674):
It should be easy

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267678):
and maybe people will find it later.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267695):
Ok so mathematicians use a lot of structures, and one structure I was brought up on is "the UK mathematician's nat", namely {1,2,3,...}

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267698):
Ok so how do we define the UK mathematician's nat?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267701):
Well pretty clearly we could define it like the computer scientist's nat := {0,1,2,3,...}

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267702):
we could just make a structure

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267742):
hmm

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267745):
let me fire up lean

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267771):
that's better

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267796):
I am so rubbish at structures

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267810):
aah bingo

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267813):
it's not a structure

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267817):
it's an inductive type

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267819):
```lean
inductive pnat
| one : pnat 
| succ : pnat â†’ pnat 

```

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267820):
So there's pnat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267825):
and that would work

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267870):
and we could define addition and multiplication and prove addition is commutative

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267873):
and do all that stuff again

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267877):
and that's stuff we already did with nat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267879):
and that's kind of a waste

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267889):
it would be nice to inherit all those theorems about nat and get them to pnat immediately

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267896):
so let's take a look at what they did in Lean or mathlib, wherever they defined pnat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267932):
Ok so it's in mathlib

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267936):
which means that computer scientists are not interested in this structure

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267939):
You can get to it with "import data.pnat"

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267943):
let's find it on github

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267993):

There it is.

Last modified two days ago!

Things never stand still around here

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268022):
OK so I'm going to talk through this file, or at least what I understand of this file, which is pretty much all of it I hope

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268029):
and the first thing we notice

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268034):
is that on line 1

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268037):
they don't define it using an inductive structure like nat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268039):
they define it as a _subtype_

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268041):
which is a bit more annoying to use in practice

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268066):
oh wait I skipped a line

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268093):
`import tactic.basic`

let's come back to that line when I have figured out why it's there

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268104):

And there it is.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268107):
There are sets `{x | blah}`

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268110):
and there are subtypes `{x // blah}`

this one is a subtype

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268135):
don't mind me I'm just editing mathlib

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268138):
Ok so I was trying to work out what a subtype was

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268140):
but I know the answer

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268197):
to make a pnat you have to give two pieces of data

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268200):
1) a nat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268204):
2) a proof that it's positive

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268209):
(that's > 0 for you French speakers)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268220):
so here's an example

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268230):
`definition x : pnat := âŸ¨59,oh crapâŸ©`

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268232):
that didn't go well

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268235):
I was in the middle of defining 59

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268238):
and all of a sudden I needed a proof.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268240):
OK so let's try again but this time be prepared

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268288):

Ok that went better

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268295):
I cheated with my proof that 59 > 0 by saying the proof was sorry (which means "just assume it")

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268298):
and now I can finally make my pnat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268311):
This is going to be pretty inconvenient having to prove that things are positive

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268316):
but actually in a couple of lines we're going to see a really good way of doing it

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268324):

Those are the next couple of lines

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268373):
The first one is easy: it sets up notation, and we're going to use the completely non-standard notation `â„•+` for pnat

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268376):
as opposed to a little plus or a little star or whatever the French use, maybe some sub zero or super zero

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268383):
this sort of thing is a minefield

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268387):
`â„•+` will do

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127268413):
and now this incomprehensible coe line is where we start making the interface for our structure

because we are already finished with the structure

OK so what do we need for mul -- clearly we need a proof that if a > 0 and b > 0 then a * b > 0, and we think of what a good name for this lemma would be, and we think "oh maybe `mul_pos_of_pos_of_pos`

and in particular in a couple of weeks when I am supposed to be teaching a bunch of mathematicians Lean and they don't know how to make structures
