Lol, I'm quite sure that the definition of `coverage` is wrong. I should demand that the collection of covers contains the singletons `{id : U ‚ü∂ U}` for every `U : X`.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 08 2018 at 14:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147299259):
If I'm right, this is also missing on nLab.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 16:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147532006):
I retract this. There is a comment on nLab pointing out that you don't need to demand that identity morphisms cover. It doesn't change your category of sheaves.

#### [Kenny Lau (Nov 12 2018 at 16:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147532080):
did you say nlab...

man you've gone too far...

`opens X` is now a site!
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/sheaf/category_theory/sheaf.lean#L245

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 20:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147545202):
This is one of the ugliest proofs I've written in a long time.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 20:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147545468):
Also, I would like to get some feedback on the definition of the `covers` for `opens X`. This is the actual data that goes into a `site`. The rest doesn't matter, because it's only proofs. (They should of course be faster then what I have now.)
Basically, there are at least three (equivalent) ways to specify the data of `covers`:
1) `covers := Œª U Us, U.val = ‚®Üu‚ààUs, (u:over _).left.val` ‚Äî take the union in `set X`
2) `covers := Œª U Us, U = ‚®Üu‚ààUs, (u:over _).left` ‚Äî take the "union" in `opens X`
3) `covers := Œª U Us, U = limits.sigma (Œª u‚ààUs, (u:over _))` ‚Äî take the "union" as a colimit in the category `over U`
Do people already see reasons to choose/discard one of these options?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 20:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147545537):
I currently have option (2). But maybe option (3) is actually better, even though it is high-brow; because it would tie in better to all the facts that we (will) have about functors/limits/etc...

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 12 2018 at 20:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147547765):
I wonder whether using actual families (instead of `set` everywhere) would make your life easier

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 12 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147547907):
Maybe this isn't actually causing any difficulty

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 21:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147548610):
Hmm, I had that before, and it actually became harder... also, you run into more universe issues, I think.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576521):
`sheaf.lean` is now `sorry`-free. In particular, I have defined the site on a basis of a topology.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 13 2018 at 09:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576576):
@**Ramon Fernandez Mir** you might be interested in this. @**Johan Commelin** where is this work? Is it on github?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576586):
My todo-list:

* Clean up the proofs
* Prove that continuous functions to some space `T` form a sheaf on `X`
* Generalise to sheaves with values in `C` (e.g., `C = CommRing` or `Ab`)
* Define stalks
* Build an API around everything

@**Scott Morrison|110087** Would you mind testing your most powerful version of `obviously` on (parts) of the proofs at the bottom of `sheaf.lean`? As you can see I'm mostly doing what `tidy` would do, except that I sprinkle an occasional `rw` into the mix.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576748):
(If you have time for this...)

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 09:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576890):
Hi @**Johan Commelin** , we should combine/adapt the stuff I wrote on bundled presheaves at some point, with a category structure based on:
```
structure Presheaf :=
(X : Top.{v})
(ùí™ : (opens X)·µí·µñ ‚•§ C)

structure Presheaf_hom (F G : Presheaf.{u v} C) :=
(f : F.X ‚ü∂ G.X)
(c : G.ùí™ ‚üπ ((opens.map f).op ‚ãô F.ùí™))
```

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 09:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576895):
Am I right that you haven't got this yet?

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 09:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147576897):
I think most of the other stuff I'd done previously on sheaves is all obsolete by your recent progress.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147577022):
(I don't have stalks yet :lol:)

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147577025):
Why would you want the bundled presheaves?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147577047):
To define morphisms of ringed spaces?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147577051):
I think I would first do that unbundled.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 09:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147577899):
Hmmm, I just realised that I don't even know what it means to be a sheaf with values in `C` when working on an arbitrary site.
I can make sense of it
* if the site has pullbacks, or
* if `C` is *concrete* in the sense that it comes with a forgetful functor to `Type`.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147578584):
@**Mario Carneiro** Do you have any tips on what the right "go-for-it" route would be in this case?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147578592):
We want sheaves of rings.
There are 23 definitions that are all math-equivalent.

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 10:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580288):
There's no way to do it as a ring object in sheaves?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580305):
That is one of the 23 possibilities (-;

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580313):
But then you need to connect it to all the useful things that we know already about rings.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580320):
This is math-trivial, of course

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580363):
A lot of them aren't true for sheafy rings

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580367):
But now you actually need to justify it to a computer.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580381):
Sure, but there is an extremely large bunch of trivialities that are true

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580399):
Is there any way to work with sheaves directly as nonclassical types?

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580463):
so that all of the theorems for rings that don't use classical assertions hold?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580575):
What exactly do you mean?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580580):
Working internally in some topos?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580598):
Or you want to lift all constructive results into every topos?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580615):
Nothing like that currently exists. And pulling it off would be quite a non-trivial project.

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580710):
Yeah, I agree

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580756):
@**Scott Morrison|110087** Do you think the current definition of `sheaf` is ok?
```lean
def sheaf (X : Type u) [ùí≥ : site.{u} X] :=
{ F : presheaf X (Type u) // nonempty (site.sheaf_condition F) }
```
I need the ugly `nonempty` because `is.iso` is not a `Prop`. What is the correct Lean-idiom for this?

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580770):
Why not just use a sigma type?

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580779):
The category of presheaves will not care about the evidence you provide

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580780):
I want to use `full_subcategory`

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580787):
But maybe I shouldn't?

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580792):
so use `sigma_category`, which I think hasn't landed in mathlib

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580795):
but is the same idea, it just ignores the extra data

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580839):
If you think about it, this is a perfectly sensible thing to do categorically:

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580842):
Ok... I see. Which branch do I need to merge into `sheaf` to do that?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580848):
Yeah, the idea is obvious. I just didn't want to roll my own tooling.

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580850):
you can have something that acts as a full subcategory, but actually makes many copies of the objects that you're keeping, according to the different ways to witness that you want them ...

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580854):
/me is lazy...

I think it's only in `lean-category-theory`

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 10:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580862):
so it's not just merging a branch

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 10:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147580876):
Aaah, then I'll leave a TODO above the current definition.

Sure, but I don't know if it actually occurs.

Sure. Say you have a set of objects C, and a function f : C \to Set. Make a new category with objects (X, Y), where Y is in f(X), and whose morphisms (X, Y) to (X', Y') are just the C-morphisms from X to X'.

It would be like taking the category of groups with all functions as morphisms

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 13 2018 at 11:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147581095):
Does it have a name?

It just makes f(X) many copies of the object X.

it looks like it's related to the 'anafunctor' version of a subcategory?

@**Harry Gindi** Here is a math question that I don't know the answer to. In what generality do people speak of sheaves on a site $$X$$ with values in a category $$C$$?
What assumptions do I need to make on $$X$$ and/or $$C$$? Is there some grand theory that unifies everything?

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147581290):
people sometimes say "sheaves of X" in all kinds of cases, but it only makes sense when X is a subcategory of algebras for some algebraic theory rel set

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 13 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147581304):
Well, if the site $$X$$ has pullbacks, then I guess the sheaf condition makes sense in every category $$C$$ with equalizers, right?

#### [Harry Gindi (Nov 13 2018 at 11:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147581351):
yes, but it is usually the wrong thing

Ok, so it works but is useless.

Ok, I'll have to think a bit about how to move this forward. I'm not sure if I'm ready for defining all the stuff related to algebraic theories.

It might make more sense if you could relativize algebraic stuff to like parameterized types?

when the category is concrete, being a sheaf with values in C is the same thing as asking that the underlying sheaf of sets is a sheaf

You have to be pretty careful with this statement. It's not just "concrete" (e.g. topological rings have a faithful functor to Set) You also need that the forgetful functor is continuous and reflects isos.

Hmmm, I just realised that I don't even know what it means to be a sheaf with values in `C` when working on an arbitrary site.
I can make sense of it
* if the site has pullbacks, or
* if `C` is *concrete* in the sense that it comes with a forgetful functor to `Type`.

that is, you can define a group object, ring object etc but nothing about these definitions will connect them to the usual algebraic classes, and there won't be a general procedure for inputting a universal algebra and getting a predicate in category theory language

I realize that maybe it's not very obvious what the module I linked to is doing--it's showing that for $$A_0$$, $$A_1$$ closed subsets of a space X, there is a pushout square in Top involving $$A_0 \cap A_1$$, $$A_0$$, $$A_1$$, $$A_0 \cup A_1$$. For open subsets you would use the other lemma from topology I mentioned, and then it's the same as checking the sheaf condition I guess.

You need `choice` to go from "for each x there exists a y such that ..." to a function mapping x to the corresponding y, even if you know that the corresponding y is also unique. So in that sense it's not exactly analogous to the axiom of choice in ZFC

 Indeed, I was dealing with continuous functions on two closed sets $$ V, U$$ (where $$U, V$$ cover the overall domain $$X$$) agreeing on their intersection $$ U \cap  V$$  and I needed to construct a continuous function $$ X \to Y $$. The code (mainly done by Mario and Kevin) is at https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/Topology/Material/pasting_lemma.lean. 
Although dealing with a general covering I don't know if it can be of any help.

@**Scott Morrison|110087** Here is something that I find a bit annoying to do. I'm trying to prove that the following functor preserves colimits:
```lean
def to_Top : opens X ‚•§ Top :=
{ obj := Œª U,
          { Œ± := U.val,
            str := subtype.topological_space },
  map := Œª U V i, ‚ü®Œª x, ‚ü®x.1, (plift.down (ulift.down i)) x.2‚ü©,
    (embedding.continuous_iff embedding_subtype_val).mpr continuous_subtype_val ‚ü© }
```
Here is what I have so far:
```lean
def to_Top.preserves_colimits : preserves_colimits (@to_Top X _) :=
{ preserves := Œª J _ K c hc,
  { desc := Œª s, _ } }
```
The local context is now:
```lean
X : Type u,
_inst_1 : topological_space X,
J : Type u,
_x : small_category J,
K : J ‚•§ opens X,
c : limits.cocone K,
hc : limits.is_colimit c,
s : limits.cocone (K ‚ãô to_Top)
‚ä¢ (functor.map_cocone to_Top c).X ‚ü∂ s.X
```
The annoying thing is the pair `c, hc`. I would much rather work with `hc : has_colimit K` and `c : colimit K`. Because then I can use facts about how this colimit is defined. Of course I can build a unique isomorphism between the `c` that I got from Lean and the one that I'm interested in. But I wonder if it would make sense to change the setup a bit...

I think we can just add a lemma for that.
You're saying you want to prove: if F : C -> D and C already `has_colimits`, then to prove F preserves colimits it suffices to consider the ones provided by the `has_colimits` instance.

@**Johan Commelin** @**Kenny Lau** -- @**Ramon Fernandez Mir** asks me exactly what you are going to be doing regarding Spec of a ring. Ramon is supposed to be completely refactoring the scheme project as part of his MSc thesis; I got him to look at locally ringed spaces but now these are done modulo the assertion that the category of rings has all colimits. Then Kenny mentioned Spec -- I think it would just be less nervy for us if we knew exactly what you guys were planning on doing and what Ramon can do (he has written thousands of lines of Coq code but is new to Lean). Currently we need that colimits exist in the category of commutative rings, and that the spectrum of a ring is a locally ringed space (which of course is a lot of work, even though it's in some sense done already). The first step towards this is that the spectrum of a ring has a presheaf of rings on the basis of open sets $$D(f)$$. Shall I tell him to do this or will someone else do it by the weekend? It would be good if we could work together on this (although of course there is plenty plenty to do -- e.g. this Gamma Spec adjointness is a goal I have in mind for Ramon, something Johan suggested months ago -- and products of schemes is another thing).

in the sense that now instead of making one gigantic commutative polynomial ring in a huge set of variables and quotienting out by an ideal generated by terms of two types and then proving something about it, you'll have to build two such rings and prove something about each of them.

funny isn't it. For products and subobjects you feel like you've made progress. But colimits are quotients so it's always going to be a pain I think. I don't even really understand what the coproduct of an arbitrary set of rings looks like -- it seems to be some sort of direct limit of finite tensor products -- but of course we haven't built direct limits yet so there's a danger of going round in circles here.

 There's something I can't get to add up here. Say there's a `has_colimits` instance and also a simpler `has_filtered_colimits` instance. Now let's say I'm trying to take a colimit and it happens to be filtered. If Lean uses the `has_colimits` instance then the colimit will be constructed in one way, but if Magic notices that the colimit is filtered then it could construct it using the simpler filtered colimit construction. The two constructions will give canonically isomorphic, but probably not defeq, objects, and doesn't this give rise to a diamond?

I'm not sure if I'm using things in the right way. I'm trying to write
```lean
let G1 := (equiv_of_iso D).trans (equiv.subtype_equiv_of_subtype.{(u+1) (u+1)} Eeq),
```
where `D : F.obj ‚âÖ {p // horrible p}` is isomorphisms between a type and a subtype in the category `Type u` which I turn into an equiv.
I then want to replace the horrible right hand side with a subtype of something else, so I thought, lets use transitivity of `equiv` and feed it `Eeq`, which is:
```lean
Eeq : (limits.sigma.{u+1 u} (Œª (Ui : {x // x ‚àà c}), yoneda.{u u}.obj ((Ui.val).left)) ‚ü∂ F) ‚âÉ
  Œ† (a : {x // x ‚àà c}), F.obj ((a.val).left) :=
  equiv.trans.{u+1 u+1 u+1} (equiv_of_iso.{u} E)
    (equiv.Pi_congr_right.{u u+1 u+1}
       (Œª (Ui : {x // x ‚àà c}),
          equiv_of_iso.{u}
            (nat_iso.app.{u+1 u+1 u u} (yoneda_lemma.{u u} X) ((Ui.val).left, F) ‚â™‚â´
               ulift_trivial.{u} ((evaluation_uncurried.{u u u+1 u} X·µí·µñ (Type u)).obj ((Ui.val).left, F))))),
```
The left hand side of `Eeq` should be exactly the type of the `p` in `{p // horrible p}`.

I get the following error:
```lean
type mismatch at application
  equiv.subtype_equiv_of_subtype.{u+1 u+1} Eeq

  Eeq

@**Johan Commelin**  `rw` only work with `=` (maybe also `==`, and `<->` only works due to `propext`). Rewriting with `equiv` is hard, one needs to prove that the motive (i.e. context in which the right-hand side appears) can be transported along the `equiv`. Even ignoring dependencies, parametricity is necessary as it shows that there is no `choice` involved.

One example why it is a problem is:

We want to rewrite `e : Œ± ‚âÉ Œ≤` in `{a : Œ± // p a}`, but what would be the goal? We get something like`{b : Œ≤ // p (f‚Åª¬π b)}`. But in many cases `p` itself is also parametric, i.e. we have actually `{b : Œ≤ // @p Œ± (f‚Åª¬π b)}` (not really, as `p` is describing a term and not a constant, but I hope you get the idea) Now when we can try to adopt the structure of `p` s.t. `Œ±` is completely replaced by `Œ≤`, and then `f` isn't occurring anymore

for example, `functor_category_has_coproducts` uses `limits.has_coproducts_of_has_colimits` which needs a `limits.has_colimits_of_shape.{u v} (discrete Œ≤)` instance. Does it come from `has_colimits_of_shape_of_has_coproducts_of_shape` or `functor_category_has_colimits_of_shape`?

either way, it will eventually end up at `has_coproducts_of_shape` for the original category which comes from `has_coproducts_of_shape_of_has_coproducts` which uses `has_coproducts` which comes from an unnamed instance with definition `has_coproducts_of_has_colimits` which finally comes from the one true `has_colimits` instance for Type. I think.

FWIW, my conclusion from my first attempt was that it's probably better to do all the constructions in a manifestly natural way, like Scott did in `yoneda.lean` for example, even though the result is probably pretty unreadable.

One thing that I find often works is to work out why the `erw` are necessary. This is sometimes unrewarding, but often it is because hidden inside implicit arguments there are things that should `dsimp`, but you forgot to write the appropriate `rfl` lemmas.  Sometimes you get really lucky, and after diagnosing a problem like this you can not only change the `erw` to `rw`, but even to `dsimp`!

I've just had a quick look at that proof, Johan, and I don't seem to be able to make much improvement. :-( There does seem to be a small problem changing between `colimit` and `colim.obj`.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 29 2018 at 08:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/148770849):
So here is what I imagine `derive rflsimp` (or whatever) should do: it looks at the current definition, and (as far as I thought this through, which is not that far) it does two checks:
* the definition is an "abbreviation" (like `def presheaf C := C \functor Type v`. In this case it looks up all the rflsimp lemmas that it derived for `C \functor D` and defines copies in the `presheaf` namespace.
* the definition `X` is a structure. In this case it looks up all the fields. For a field `foo` it checks whether this is a Pi-type (?) and how many arguments the Pi takes. So if `foo := Œª a b c, bar(a,b,c)` then it will create the appropriate simp-lemma (proved by `rfl`) that
```lean
@[simp] lemma X.foo (x : X) (a b c : some_type) :  x.foo a b c = bar(a,b,c) := rfl
```
Of course I don't know how to write `meta`-code. And of course this is probably a very simplified picture. But I think something like this should be possible, and I think it would result in three things:
* less boilerplate (especially in the category library!)
* less broken proofs, where `tidy` doesn't work, because somewhere someone forgot to state the obvious `rfl`-simp-lemma.
* less wasted time in hunting down the brokenness of the preceding point.

@**Scott Morrison|110087** Thanks for looking into speeding things up. I added a rflsimp-lemma for `colim.obj`. Do you have any clue why the first line in that proof (with the comment) didn't simplify?

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 29 2018 at 11:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/148777570):
Nope, I couldn't work it out. The next "usual suspect" for simp not working is that the thing that needs to be `simp`ed is inside a function that looks superficially dependent but actually isn't when you think about it a bit. `simp`, which needs to build congruence lemmas to do "rewriting", can't work out what do to, but `rw` can. This is a "known problem" with `simp`, apparently.

At some point Johan I made a thing which did this
It was a command called `rfl_lemma` I think. If you have access to rewrite_search you have access to it, too

@**Scott Morrison|110087** @**Keeley Hoek** I don't have `rewrite_search`. Do you think it is ready to be tested by others? If so, what do I need to do to get started?

You could always try it out! My understanding is that all you should have to do is add
````
lean-tidy = {git = "https://github.com/semorrison/lean-tidy", rev = "3a69d6241207f0c0758468dce666858027c54909"}
````
to your `leanpkg.toml` and run `leanpkg configure`. (I'm slightly worried though because `lean-tidy` obviously imports from `mathlib`, which you are working on... but I suspect it will work find (I think this is what Scott does to get his proofs using it).

#### [Keeley Hoek (Nov 29 2018 at 13:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/148782717):
Then import `tactic.rewrite_search`. You can try to discharge goals with the `rewrite_search` tactic, but make sure you tag lemmas it is allowed to use with `@[search]`. There is much more complicated stuff you can do (including more specific tagging), but that's a start!

I think what you actually have to do is copy paste the lean-tidy repo over mathlib

@**Scott Morrison|110087** @**Keeley Hoek** I can report that adding that Lean *does not* outright refuse that repo as a dependency of mathlib. However... there's tons and tons of errors. So it's not really usable in a sense.

After a long period of being distracted by other work, I've returned to the sheaves and sites project. Stuff is now happening on the `sheaf-2` branch, which has less dependencies than `sheaf`.
I am currently struggling with defining a pretty non-constructive map. I have a gadget `s` which comes with a proof that I can perform a certain construction after some choice, and the result of the construction does not depend on the choice. But how do I actually do this?
```lean
def foo (c : covering_family U) (F : presheaf X) :
(matching_sections c F) ‚ü∂ (matching_sections c.generate_sieve.val F) :=
Œª s : matching_sections c F, show matching_sections c.generate_sieve.val F, from
{ val := Œª V H,
  begin
    delta matching_sections at s,
    choose Ui H f using H,
    refine F.map _ (s.1 _ H),
  end,
  property := _ }
```
Here is what my goal window looks like
```lean
X : Type u,
_inst_1 : small_category X,
U : X,
c : covering_family U,
F : presheaf X,
V : over U,
s :
  {s // ‚àÄ (Ui : over U) (H : Ui ‚àà c) (Uj : over U) (H_1 : Uj ‚àà c) (V : over U) (f : V ‚ü∂ Ui) (g : V ‚ü∂ Uj),
     F.map (f.left) (s Ui H) = F.map (g.left) (s Uj H_1)},
Ui : over U,
H : Ui ‚àà c,
f : nonempty (V ‚ü∂ Ui)
‚ä¢ Ui.left ‚ü∂ V.left
```
What I need to do is extract some hom `f` from `V` to `Ui` out of the current `f : nonempty (_)`. I should then be able to close the goal with `exact f.left`. But I can only eliminate into `Prop` from `nonempty`. So how should I set things up?

Are you going to need to prove the resulting construction is independent of the choice?

or not necessarily at the start of the whole argument, but at the start of some subargument to satisfy some lemma which wants to take an actual map rather than just an existence statement

Ok, that worked. But I still wonder why `choose f` didn't work. @**Patrick Massot** Any ideas why `choose` doesn't work on `nonempty`?
Here's the proof that I have now
```lean

(matching_sections c F) ‚ü∂ (matching_sections c.generate_sieve.val F) :=
Œª s : matching_sections c F, show matching_sections c.generate_sieve.val F, from
{ val := Œª V H,
  begin
    delta matching_sections at s,
    choose Ui H f using H,
    refine F.map _ (s.1 _ H),
    exact (classical.choice f).left,

  property := _ }

To be precise: I have no trouble at all extending a presheaf from a basis to the whole space. The problem is checking that it sends sheaves to sheaves. The difficulty is probably due to the fact that I do not have a usable API around the sheaf condition.
And I guess my sheaf condition is hard to work with right now because I'm trying to be quite general, doing sheaves on an arbitrary site.

Oh -- the proof involves some argument on stalks which for a general site is complicated? Are there universe issues or do you only work with small sites?
