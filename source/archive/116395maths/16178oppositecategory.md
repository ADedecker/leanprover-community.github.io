I think `opposite` can have a better interface

I also had some difficulty using `opposite`. If I have a contravariant functor `F : C\op \func D` and a map `f : a \hom b` in `C` then how am I supposed to write the induced map `F b \hom F a`? @**Johan Commelin** have you already encountered this?

I think I have, but I don't really have a solution...
