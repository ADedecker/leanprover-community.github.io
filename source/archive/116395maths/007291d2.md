As @**Mario Carneiro** might know, we're doing the special case d=5, but should we generalize it and then PR it?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 27 2018 at 18:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170071):
Just for d=1 mod 4 right?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 27 2018 at 18:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170072):
I think there's definitely an argument for it.

These are pretty famous rings

we can do Z[(1+sqrt(3))/2] also, you know

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 27 2018 at 18:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170115):
d squarefree and 1 mod 4

you don't want to do that ring Kenny

it's not 2-d over Z

ok let's do Z[(1+sqrt(4d+1))/2] then

the case d>=0 and d<0 are slightly different later on

The number of units in that ring depends on whether d>=0 (always infinite) or d<0 (never)

#### [Kenny Lau (May 27 2018 at 18:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170129):
well they only did Z[sqrt(d)] for d>=0, so I don't want to have to redo everything, so I'll just do d>0

I'm not sure this is a good generalization

They're the full ring of integers of a real quadratic field

(1+sqrt n)/2 seems a bit specific

The most simple number field is Q

Then there's all the other number fields

but the second simplest class of number fields are the quadratic fields

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 27 2018 at 18:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170190):
Is there a general quadratic field?

they're all of the form Q(sqrt(t)) for t a rational that is not a square

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 27 2018 at 18:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%84%A4%5B%281%2B%E2%88%9Ad%29/2%5D/near/127170192):

Q(sqrt(t)) can cunningly be rewritten as Q(sqrt(n)) with n a square-free integer

the fields generated by sqrt(2) and sqrt(18) over Q are the same

Mario did you do Z[sqrt(9)]?
