### [#391 faster](22086391faster.html)

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349088):
How can I improve [the `faster` PR](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/391)?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349130):
I was wondering, Kenny, if it makes sense to rebase it onto the squeeze-simp PR?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349132):
Presumably that one will be reviewed and merged first, since `faster` relies on it.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349138):
If you like I can try doing that. If you don't mind compressing everything into a single commit it should be easy.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349139):
Possibly harder if you want to preserve the individual commits, but leave out the ones that have already been separated out into `squeeze-simp`.

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349179):
I'll rebase it onto `squeeze-simp` once it (i.e. `squeeze-simp`) has been merged

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349283):
Ok, I guess that's fine. It's just a piece of cleaning up work that you could do already if you're in a hurry.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349284):
I've had a scroll through the changes on this one, but I'm not really the one to comment. :-) Unreadable proofs beforehand, unreadable proofs afterwards, so if they're faster, I'd say go for it. :-)

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349287):
Ok, thanks for your review

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349408):
Some places make me a little sad:

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349409):
https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/391/files#diff-52b9e281e7667f88f8203fb617843d93L522

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349447):
When the proof used to just be `simp`, and now it's some rewrite.

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349455):
it saves a lot of speed though...

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349463):
Yes, but it's a tradeoff. It's very sad to have to write proofs of such simple things. I agree in the short term it's worth saving the speed.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349464):
But in the long run, I have to say that this is the most depressing thing I've seen in Lean yet --- the fact that we are having to do this.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349507):
I noticed there are some actual new features hiding in here: https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/391/files#diff-47cbe97193e277c9a413e62bc8afadff

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349513):
You should almost certainly take these out, and make a separate PR for them.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349517):
Oh, I see, those are the parts that Simon wrote

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349556):
and that are in the separate PR already.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349559):
(This is exactly why I suggested rebasing now --- so it's easy for us to review it already!)

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349562):
What do you mean by rebasing this PR onto squeeze_simp?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349569):
At the moment there is a fork in the history --- leading out of master is one sequence of commits leading to squeeze-simp

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349614):
and another sequence of commits leading to faster

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349620):
I was proposing making that history linear again, but so all of squeeze-simp comes first, and then the rest of faster

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349627):
and how do I do that?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349633):
Well -- do we care if all your commits get smushed into a single one?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349634):
If that's okay, we can do a squash merge.

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349636):
how does that work?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349638):
If that's not okay, I'd have to experiment --- it's at the limit of my rebase ability. :-)

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349640):
To do a squash merge, you would:

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349642):
`git checkout squeeze-simp`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349681):
`git merge --squash faster`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349684):
then look at the state of things, and make sure everything looks sane.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349685):
if it does:

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349686):
`git branch faster2`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349689):
`git checkout faster2`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349692):
`git commit -m "feat(*): make mathlib faster using simp only, rw, and rfl"`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349697):
then if everything looks okay, delete the faster branch, and rename faster2 back to faster

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349698):
and finally `git push --force community` to overwrite the old faster branch.

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349700):
how will this make the tactic changes disappear from the "Files changed"?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349705):
So it won't do that immediately in files changed, but ...

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349745):
but?

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349756):
on the changes page, if you click on the `changes from all commits` text

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349757):
you get an option to just compare across a range.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349803):
after the squash merge, the commits will be linearly ordered, so it's possible to just look at the changes after Simon was "finished" with squeeze-simp -- i.e. just showing yours

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349807):
and posting the URL for that range here would give anyone easy access to it.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349809):
(I'm not strongly saying this is worth doing... it's a possibility if you want to clean up)

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349816):
Another suggestion, for cleaning up, is that you change the name of the PR, e.g. to `feat(*): make mathlib faster using simp only, rw, and rfl`

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349820):
the convention is `XXX(FFF): CCC`, where `XXX` is `doc`, `feat`, `bug`, or `chore`, `FFF` is the files affected (perhaps abbreviated some way), and `CCC` is a short summary

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349861):
When everything is finally merged, it will be squashed to a single commit, and it makes the maintainers life slightly easier if they've got a commit message in the right format in front of them.

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349865):
what is `feat`?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349870):
feature: it's for commits that add new stuff

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349911):
I think `faster` is a `refactor` commit

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349916):
I don't think `refactor` is one of `doc`, `feat`, `bug`, or `chore`

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349917):
The list is longer than that

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 07 2018 at 13:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349922):
@**Mario Carneiro** Is there any reason why this PR is not a no-brainer?

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 07 2018 at 13:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349923):

It's a large change, that's never a no-brainer

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349966):
Kenny could you not replace `induction` with `nat.rec_on`? It's less readable

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349969):
@**Johan Commelin**, it's worth remembering that once a PR is in, little problems never get fixed again. :-)

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23391%20faster/near/135349972):
This is a one moment where there's a chance to get things right. Saying "oh, we can fix it later" turns out to be false in practice!

Sorry, not sure why you can't just `checkout`, that seems to work for me.

I *think* if you run `git fetch lc` first, then both commands (with and without the `-b`) should have the same effect.

I notice you worked on `turing_machine.lean`. While I applaud your effort, I think it was probably not a good choice. The theorems there are still under construction, as it were; I'm not certain that they will keep their current form, and if so the original proofs with `simp` will be more robust to changes. Moreover, those proofs are very CSy in the sense that they are proving simple properties of complicated objects; it is in this situation where `simp` has the biggest advantage, and the proofs without it are much longer and more brittle.

I will accept the changes since the file is on mathlib and everyone feels the compilation overhead (at least, if they are compiling everything in mathlib - it's not a dependent of any other files), but probably I should move the file out of mathlib altogether.

Actually, the best might just be to redo the work with `squeeze_simp`. That was before I wrote it and I was trying to leave the proofs mostly unchanged. I think `squeeze_simp` is better at this.
