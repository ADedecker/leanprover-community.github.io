### [Noob: 50 = 40 -> false](27205Noob5040false.html)

#### [Kevin Sullivan (Oct 30 2018 at 04:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136752030):
What would be the cleanest / canonical way to prove this in a tactic script? nat.no_confusion only works when the left side is zero.

Also, when I'm proving a set membership proposition, such as x \in S, what can I do to have the goal rewritten as the underlying proposition, e.g., x = 1 \/ x = 2 \/ false, for the claim that x \in {1, 2}?

1) have you tried `norm_num` from `tactic.norm_num`? 
2) have you tried `simp`?

If 50 and 40 are nats then because equality is decidable on nat you can do `example : 50 = 40 → false := dec_trivial`

but that isn't the fastest way

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 08:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136760773):
no but it is the canonical way

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 08:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136760776):
and it scores highly for clean as well

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 08:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136760851):
As for the other question, `x ∈ ({1, 2} : set ℕ)` is *definitionally equal* to `x = 2 ∨ x = 1 ∨ false` and you can just treat the goal like it said this, e.g.

```lean
example (x : ℕ) (H : x = 1) : x ∈ ({1, 2} : set ℕ) :=
begin
  right,
  left,
  assumption
end
```

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 08:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136760896):
The pretty printer assumes you'd rather see `x ∈ {1, 2}` so leaves it like that. If you want to explicitly change it then you can use `change`, a tactic which will change the goal to a definitionally equal goal. 

```lean
example (x : ℕ) (H : x = 2) : x ∈ ({1, 2} : set ℕ) :=
begin
  change x = 2 ∨ x = 1 ∨ false,
  left,
  assumption
end
```

Thank you. Up until now I've avoided using anything that my (mostly) young undergraduates won't understand from first principles. But now, it's time for black box tactics. I won't be able to explain dec_trivial to them, but it is clean and is supported in the standard libraries. As for "change," thanks for that. I was trying unfold, but it didn't get me all the way to the disjunction that defines a set.

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 18:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136792029):
I think `dec_trivial` has a clean explanation in the type theory. Roughly, there is a term of type `nat -> nat -> bool` that says whether two natural numbers are equal or not, and we assert that this is `tt` by refl, so in order for the `dec_trivial` term to typecheck it forces computation of this function. The function itself is easy to define by recursion on the natural numbers.

```lean
--set_option pp.notation false
example (x : ℕ) (H : x = 2) : x ∈ ({1, 2} : set ℕ) :=
begin
  unfold has_mem.mem,
  unfold set.mem,
  unfold has_insert.insert,
  unfold set.insert,
  unfold has_mem.mem,
  unfold set.mem,
  unfold singleton,
  unfold has_insert.insert,
  unfold set.insert,
  unfold has_mem.mem,
  unfold set.mem,
  unfold has_emptyc.emptyc,
  left,
  assumption
end
```

We don't quite land at where you want though, the goal ultimately is
```
{b : ℕ | b = 2 ∨ {b : ℕ | b = 1 ∨ false} b} x
```

When I knew less about Lean, I used to write code which looked like this a lot, and then when I'd finished doing all the unfolding I'd just replace it all with a `change` (or `show` -- they're the same I think, although `change ... at h` works with hypotheses too).

you should unfold `set_of` too

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136803362):
I should have switched `pp.notation false` back on one last time!

also you can make that shorter by making one big `unfold`

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136803551):
since you won't have to cycle back through the same things

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 21:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Noob%3A%2050%20%3D%2040%20-%3E%20false/near/136803745):

I never knew that. I knew I could put them all in one line but I hadn't appreciated that `unfold x y z` behaved differently to `unfold x, unfold y, unfold z`
