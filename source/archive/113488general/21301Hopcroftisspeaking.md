Hopcroft is speaking!

Can you see the livestream still? Atiyah is meant to be on, but the livestream doesn't work for me.

(I get redirected to a login page.)

I got on 45 minutes earlier so I can see the original livestream

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 09:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134511657):
the link is a livestream of quite poor quality, but that's Heidelberg Laureate Forum's fault

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 09:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134511661):
anyway they'll upload to youtube later

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 09:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134511690):
15 minutes in, still introducing the theorem

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 10:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134511759):
(no, I don't know how to livestream my computer's audio)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 24 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134511941):
I think you will learn more from watching Mario's live stream than Prof Sir Mike's.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 24 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512018):
The whole Atiyah story is rather sad and it's a shame that it's come to this. The community knows that he is an elderly man who has become a little deluded. He has spent his entire mathematical life thinking in an extremely flexible way and showing mathematicians the path through treacherous terrains with insightful ideas.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 24 2018 at 10:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512080):
But now he is under the unfortunate impression that general ideas about how to proceed actually equal proofs. He has been like this for a few years, this is well-known amongst the geometry community (at least in the UK). Quite how it has come to this I don't know and really it's rather sad.

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 10:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512088):
he mentioned in the abstract of the talk that his result is based on von Neumann and Hirzebruch and Dirac

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 10:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512139):
now he used the first two guys' result that generalizes Euler's formula to quaternions

#### [Scott Morrison (Sep 24 2018 at 10:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512213):
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNbTDKljpUR-4im-IxqluY1tKer88-mH/view> seems to be associated with today's talk.

#### [Scott Morrison (Sep 24 2018 at 10:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512220):
Indeed it's a shame that the HLF organisers let this happen.

well someone else would let this happen

he is Michael Atiyah

It's a huge shame that HLF organizers arranged that. I guess they would use any big name
