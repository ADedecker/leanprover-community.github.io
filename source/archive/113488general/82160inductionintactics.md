### [induction in tactics](82160inductionintactics.html)

#### [Jakob von Raumer (Apr 30 2018 at 15:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/induction%20in%20tactics/near/125893367):
Say I write a tactic that somewhere uses `induction x` for some `x`. Now I get back a list of goals. Is it better style to use that list to tackle each goal, or should I use `tactic.focus`?
