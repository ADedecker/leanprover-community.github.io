I have a question for people who understand how Lean actually works. I had a very big proof that took forever to compile, and sometimes timed out. I broke that proof in two pieces, introducing a completely artificial lemma, statement how to go half way along the road. Now it's super fast. What's happening? I understand there is something called https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1601 which tells me I cannot work interactively with big proofs. But I don't understand why it changes the non-interactive compilation time.
