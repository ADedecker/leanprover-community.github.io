@**Gabriel Ebner** could we get two variants of F12, one creating a new tab if a new file needs to be opened, and one replacing the content of the current tab, as it currently does? Also, could we get key bindings for "Go back" and "Restart Lean"? And maybe one for "Create a comment below the current line, containing what is currently in the Lean messages view"? About Lean messages, each time I press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open this tab, it also opens a copy of the file I'm currently editing. It's annoying and I think it wasn't like this before.

alt-left should be a key binding for "go back"

I also noticed the bug with ctrl-shift-enter opening a copy over the message view

You can set your key bindings yourself btw

It makes me think I would really love to know a way to ask VScode to trigger translation immediately rather than waiting for a blank space of movement. It would really help to type words containing several special unicode characters.

But how would you deal with prefixes? Such as `\t` vs `\to`?

I think if you type `\t` you get the triangle but underlined, and typing `o` changes it to an arrow

I don't need it to be automatic, I want to be able to *ask* for it before VScode decides it should do it anyway

Sweet. So if I would type `\Zp` would that give me â„¤p?

But you can assign "open definition to the side" to whatever keybinding you like.

Currently F12 and other navigation commands only replace the content of the current tab if you are viewing a file in temporary mode, indicated with italics in the tab title

you can clear temporary mode by clicking on the title or editing anywhere

"Go back"

ctrl+alt+- is the default keybinding.  I usually use the vim keybindings, where it is ctrl+t as expected.

I'm currently having a bit of trouble publishing the vscode extension, so you'll have to wait a bit for the update.

I managed to escape.  The only new feature is "ctrl+shift+p copy contents to comment", which copies the current content of the info view to a comment below the current line, as requested by @**Patrick Massot**.

#### [Chris Hughes (Jul 27 2018 at 23:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130435618):
One slightly annoying new feature of VSCode, is that when I click "Display Goal", it opens the file I have open in the right pane. Is there a way to do anything about that?

I've added a feature in emacs (taken from `company-coq`) to use `diff` to compare the actual / expected types in error messages. Any chance I might convince you to add it to VS code or help me implement it for VS code?

This bug should be fixed with yesterday's update.

```

Sure, I am happy about new features.  How did you extract the expected/actual type from the error message?  Regex?

If you want to implement it yourself, look at how `_lean.revealPosition` is implemented in the info view (this handles the click on the message title and scrolls to the corresponding position in the file): https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/b872639347221a0146bf4e98234ee55e3d634b30/src/infoview.ts#L375
I think we can add a link to the diff right next to it.  You can show the diff with `workspace.openTextDocument` and `window.showTextDocument`.  Feel free to add a diff library to the dependencies.

I tried installing the lean VScode update, and now opening VScode instantly freezes my computer. Anyone else experiencing this problem?

If I find the extension in VS code I am only offered "disable" and "uninstall". I seem to be on version 0.11.11 (and on Ubuntu)

More to the point -- the bug is fixed for me and I have no problems with the extension. So I guess I upgraded safely. Anyone on Windows having the same problems with...Chris? Are you on 0.11.11? Oh -- you can't even tell?

As a temporary measure you can uninstall the lean extension and then try and figure out how to install an older version. I can't reproduce here on linux; things are working fine for me. Can you switch logging on somehow? This might happen to every Windows user who has auto-update on.

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jul 28 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130461142):

Chris can you switch on some debugging output, have the current extension loaded, and then open a Lean file? What happens exactly after you open a lean file? You said your computer freezes? What OS are you using? Win7 or Win10?

#### [Chris Hughes (Jul 28 2018 at 12:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130461228):

If everything else fails, can you try to reinstall vscode and lean completely.  I am really at a loss here, there are almost no changes between vscode-lean 0.11.9 and 0.11.11, and none that look in any way dangerous.  I am running the lean 3.4.1 release on windows 10 and vscode 1.25.1 here.

What I did is split the error message into lines and find the line that says `"has type:"` and I take everything until I find the line announcing the expected type.

So I just tried upgrading on a Win10 machine and I've got it working. It did crash VS code -- but a restart of VS code (twice) got it working in the end. It didn't take down the OS.

The program (but not the OS) hung -- it became unresponsive. I restarted the program twice and got it working. I don't use Windows usually so I don't know if this is normal after an upgrade.

I've been playing around with this and I can do `#eval`, `#check` just fine, but the second I type `lemma` or `theorem`, Lean eats all my memory and hits disc to the point the system can't recover. Surprisingly enough `example` doesn't crash it.

#### [Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel (Jul 29 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130513560):
Actually it's VS Code that does that (unsurprisingly), because when I close the lean subprocess of VS-code parent, it doesn't fix anything.

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jul 29 2018 at 09:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130513763):
Do you also get the high memory usage with the info view closed (the tab "Lean Messages")?

#### [Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel (Jul 29 2018 at 09:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130513774):
Yes, it doesn't matter whether the info window is open or not. Just to clarify I'm on win 10.

#### [Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel (Jul 29 2018 at 09:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130513906):
I run this off of an HDD, if that helps it completely thrashes the hard drive as well, but this may very well be just a side-effect of memory om-nom.

Yes, that's just swapping and it's because of the high memory usage.  The operating system just moves some stuff from RAM to HDD in order to make space.

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jul 29 2018 at 09:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130513984):
Just to make sure: in the task manager, how much memory does the lean subprocess use compared to the rest of vscode?

Negligable if I can even get it to update. The thing is, when I type `lemma` and I close VS within a second, it recovers. When I type `lemma` and I close just the `lean` subprocess of the tree, it doesn't recover. It's gigabytes of memory instantly for VSCode and some dozens of megabytes for lean.

Sorry I'm slow since my family returned from vacations. It works great! Next wish: do you think you could get VScode to offer to fold namespaces and sections like it folds statements and proofs?

If VS code is capable of knowing which namespace we're in then I would find it super-helpful if this could be displayed in some way -- I sometimes find my cursor in the middle of a large file really wanting to know what namespace I'm in.

the commit does a bit more than just adding `abbreviation` as a keyword as it claims; some additional stuff is added to the keyword recognition stuff at the end and I suspect it is triggering a memory leak in the regex parser

I don't think you have to completely revert it; there is nothing wrong with adding `abbreviation` to the list, only the regex needs to be tweaked so that it doesn't match an infinite number of empty strings

In VScode, if I select some text that is to be replaced, and I start typing a string the expected behaviour occurs. Except... Except when I start the replacement string with a `\`, then it is not expanded into a unicode character. So if I select "foobar" and then type `\lam x y`, I don't get a cool lambda.

I'm just saying that most points on the list are either infeasible right now, or shouldn't go into the vscode extension.
If you want to start experimenting right now, I think the naming convention automation is the lowest hanging fruit.  You can implement `#how_do_you_call âˆ€ x y, x < y â†’ x - y = 0` as a user command for example.

The next best is maybe "turn current goal into lemma".  You can do this as a tactic that outputs the text for the lemma as an error message.  The user can then copy&paste it where they want.  Last time I talked with Rob and Johannes there was the suggestion to parse tags like `<insert-above>lemma foo : a â†’ b := sorry</insert-above>` in the error messages, but imho that's a bit too hacky unless there is a significant need for it.

In my experience sometimes it doesn't show something, and then you hit escape and then ctrl-space again, and then it shows them, although I noted this behaviour months ago and cannot say for sure that it still occurs.

Yeah, the current server protocol doesn't really allow for another (efficient) option. I've thought about this, but it's not clear at all how this could work especially when we move to storing messages in an immutable Lean data structure.

It's by design I think. The language server protocol specifies this behavior explicitly.  There is an issue in the github repo, but I am not sure if they'll ever change it.  Note that JavaScript also uses this utf-16 indexing for strings.

If you're referring to the fact that the info view window goes blank for long periods while typing (inconsistently depending on the type of input?), I've also experienced this on both Mac and Windows and I complained about it [here](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/issues/92). I wasn't able to figure out how to fix the underlying issue, but as a workaround, [I submitted a PR](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/pull/93) which allows you to assign a keystroke to toggle pausing the infoview. So now I just hit my keybind for `lean.infoview.toggleUpdating`before typing, and hit it again when I'm done, which feels somewhat better.

@**Gabriel Ebner** How hard would it be to implement a toggle that enables/disables whether Lean is interactive. Sometimes I would like to disable the interactivity to paste a chunk of "almost-Lean" (for example from the goal window) and massage it into Lean-code. After that, I would reenable interactivity, so that the code would be sent of to the server.
In this way, you wouldn't have the server constantly choking on the almost-Lean code, of which you already know that it won't parse...

Well, the two features are completely independent.
For the "pause" feature, I think the easiest way would be prevent syncing the file contents here: https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/d70dfa121bc616100c14bc0fd24400b9962922da/src/sync.ts#L36  You'd probably also want to disable autocompletion, hover, go-to-definition, etc. in that mode.
Add a command to toggle the pause flag, and when unsetting it, resync all files.  There is theoretically also an option in the roi setting (press on the Lean item in the status bar, and then select "nothing"); but the server still recompiles stuff for autocompletion etc.

At least when you are working on "almost-Lean" code.

Otherwise I could also just edit inside a comment block. But I would like to have some of the cheaper interaction, like syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

Anyway, I have never worked with typescript before, and I have no idea where to start if I would want to modify the VScode extension. But I would certainly like to learn this. Has someone ever twitched work on the Lean-VScode extension?
