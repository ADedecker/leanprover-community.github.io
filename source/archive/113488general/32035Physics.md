Hey, I'm curious - are there any physicists here looking at formalising some of the vector algebra for quantum theory? I couldn't find anything related to e.g. Hilbert spaces.

A first year undergraduate student of mine formalised the definition of Hilbert spaces as part of their summer project, but I don't think there's anything in the official maths library.

I don't recall any physicists coming forward openly. But if you are one, you'd better [beware](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/physics.20attack/near/134230265).

https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/Banach%20spaces.lean and and there are inner product spaces too, but actually I don't see Hilbert space yet.

Iâ€™m pretty sure I fixed the issue with Hilbert space so hope to PR soon

Although I only have one trivial lemma about Hilbert Spaces specifically

Ok, thanks! I was looking at (maybe) formalising some results that require notions of a Hilbert space.
@**Andreas Swerdlow** do you mean it might be included in mathlib at some point?

Hopefully, but it probably needs some cleaning up
