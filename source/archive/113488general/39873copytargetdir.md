I really don't understand how the `_target` directory works

I want to help Kevin so I clone his repo

Of course it depends on mathlib

So I try to copy `_target` from my own projects to avoid compiling mathlib

and it doesn't seem to work

or maybe it does

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/copy%20_target%20dir/near/127204676):
it seemed like VScode was taking forever to compile

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/copy%20_target%20dir/near/127204680):
which seemed like it was compiling lots of files

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/copy%20_target%20dir/near/127204686):
but maybe it was only Kevin's code

I have symlinked the `_target` dir before. It seems to work fine.
