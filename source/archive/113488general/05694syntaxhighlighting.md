William Stein says:

"Kevin - which of the modes listed here is closest to working for lean code?

https://codemirror.net/mode/index.html

I can modify an existing syntax highlighting mode to make it work properly..."

"Regarding code editor syntax highlighting, I haven't found a good highlighting. Maybe we can create one for codemirror, though. Is there a simple language definition, where we for example can get a concise list of all keywords? I also checked what they are doing for that online live "lean" editor. This interface is based on the "monaco" editor [1]. They seem to have written their own plugins for it. CoCalc doesn't use Monco, but CodeMirror, though."
