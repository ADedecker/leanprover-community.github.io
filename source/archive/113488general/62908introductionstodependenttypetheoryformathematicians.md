### [introductions to dependent type theory for mathematicians](62908introductionstodependenttypetheoryformathematicians.html)

#### [Scott Morrison (Mar 15 2018 at 06:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/introductions%20to%20dependent%20type%20theory%20for%20mathematicians/near/123737728):
At tea today some colleagues expressed interest in learning about dependent type theory (interactive theorem proving may still be a bridge too far... :-). Does anyone have favourite recommendations for introductions, especially written for a "working mathematician" audience?

I'd be curious to see how far you can go using type theory as a tool without type checker

My angle on the subject has of course only been from the user's perspective so I'll admit that there's probably a whole world I know nothing about

hmm, i would recommend ncatlab to a mathematician... the references section seems through

I think the HoTT book is the best introduction to dependent type theory from a mathematician perspective

just remember to get off the bus when they start talking about iterated identity types :)

Great! I'm very happy that my first two suggestions have been echoed here. :-) I also like Mike Schulman's post at <https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/in_praise_of_dependent_types.html>.
