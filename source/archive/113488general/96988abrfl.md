### [`a = b := rfl`](96988abrfl.html)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 12 2018 at 13:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131994333):
```lean
definition xena.zero : ℕ := 0 

theorem easy : xena.zero = nat.zero := rfl
```

I usually stop thinking when it's got to this point -- my zeros are equal by definition and we're done. Yesterday, perhaps inspired by Ed's barrage, which reminded me how little I still knew about some aspects of Lean, I decided to dig a bit deeper into this easy theorem. I tried to take it apart completely given what I knew.

Setting `pp.all true` shows me that my goal is

```
@eq.{1} nat xena.zero nat.zero
```

which is fine. My first question is how `rfl` is proving this. I'm assuming that the output of `#print rfl` is the code that's being run here. 

```
@[pattern]
def rfl : ∀ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, @eq.{u} α a a :=
λ {α : Sort u} {a : α}, @eq.refl.{u} α a
```

I have some things to solve here. I will set `u=1` for the universe, and now for the `{}` brackets I need to solve for `α` and `a`. Well `α` is easy, it's `nat`, but for `a` I seem to have two choices. `a = xena.zero` and `a=nat.zero` and neither of them are on the face of it right. One seems to create a term of type `@eq.{1} nat xena.zero xena.zero` and the other a term of type `@eq.{1} nat nat.zero nat.zero`. 

Whichever one Lean chooses, it -- by which I mean *something* -- is now faced with the problem that I am claiming that two types are equal when they are not literally the same thing. The same what? The same expressions? 

Proving that these two types are equal (`@eq.{1} nat xena.zero nat.zero` and `@eq.{1} nat a a` for whatever `rfl` decided to let `a` be -- how do I find out, by the way?) seems to be a case of proving `xena.zero` and `nat.zero` are the same term of type `nat`. So Lean has somehow now reduced to checking that these terms are the same. But the expressions (if they are expressions) are presumably different. 

What presumably happens next is that Lean has to try and check that both terms evaluate to the same term of type `nat`. Now `nat.zero` seems like it's somehow "fully evaluated" -- `#print nat.zero` indicates that it's a constructor of `nat` and we somehow can't get any further. On the other hand, `#print xena.zero` seems to indicate that more work needs to be done. The parser, or something, has interpreted `0 : nat` as `@has_zero.zero.{0} nat nat.has_zero`. I can't quite work out how -- `0` does not seem to be notation. I think Mario once told me that it was the "number literal parser" which changes `0` to `@has_zero.zero.{0} nat nat.has_zero`. So...*something* is now faced with the of verifying that `@has_zero.zero.{0} nat nat.has_zero` evaluates to `nat.zero`. I can understand that `nat.has_zero` has magically appeared because the type class inference system produced it, and looking at the definition of `has_zero.zero` I can see that this term evaluates to `nat.has_zero.zero`. This is a funny...term? expr? because I can't `#print` it even though I can `#check` it. I can `#reduce` it but I feel like this might be cheating -- I can `#reduce xena.zero` and everything gets unravelled. What is `#reduce` doing here? Is this all the alpha-equivalence beta-reduction stuff? 

Feeling like `#reduce nat.has_zero.zero` was cheating, I right-clicked on it -- I don't know any other way of seeing the definition, because `#print` doesn't work and `#reduce` does too much. Is there a way to investivate more carefully what type class inference did here? Right-clicking takes me to core Lean where I find `instance : has_zero nat := ⟨nat.zero⟩`, so indeed it was `nat.zero` after all.

Whose job am I doing here? What does all this have to do with `expr`s and `pexpr`s?

>  for whatever rfl decided to let a be -- how do I find out, by the way?

If you `#print easy` with `pp.all` you will see `@rfl.{1} nat xena.zero`, so rfl chose the LHS, forcing it to check `@eq.{1} nat xena.zero xena.zero =?= @eq.{1} nat xena.zero nat.zero`.

I've seen you write `=?=` many times here, and I still don't know what it means. I understand that the job Lean has to somehow do is to check LHS = RHS. What does `=?=` indicate though?

yes, it is used in unification and also pure defeq checking

the elaborator also solves this problem (both the kernel and the elaborator have slightly different approaches to solving defeq problems)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 12 2018 at 14:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131994760):
Right, I think I've also seen it in the context `?m_1 =?= nat` with metavariables. That's the same usage?

yes

somewhere deep in the kernel, yes, more or less, although that list is spread over the recursive calls to `is_def_eq` rather than explicitly maintained

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 12 2018 at 14:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131994964):
```lean
/-- Succeeds if `t` and `s` can be unified using the given transparency setting. -/
meta constant unify (t s : expr) (md := semireducible) (approx := ff) : tactic unit
/-- Similar to `unify`, but it treats metavariables as constants. -/
meta constant is_def_eq (t s : expr) (md := semireducible) (approx := ff) : tactic unit
```
The fact that these are constants somehow indicates that they are not written in Lean but perhaps in C++. How does Lean know that these are any different to `meta constant foo : nat` ? And what told Lean to use `is_def_eq`? Again is this something written in `C++`? I don't want to read any `C++` at this point, but I'd like to be able to get as far as it (hence at some point I'm going to have to read some tactic code, but not today)

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 14:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131995011):
Here's the process for checking defeq:

* Since `eq` is an axiomatic constant, it can't be unfolded, so it checks that the parts are equal, reducing to `xena.zero =?= nat.zero`.
* Since `xena.zero` has greater definitional height, and `nat.zero` is a constant anyway, it unfolds `xena.zero := @has_zero.zero.{0} nat nat.has_zero`.
* `has_zero.zero` is a builtin projection, which I'm not sure how lean handles - if it is unfolded you see a macro for the projection and it's tricky to unfold these. For now let's just pretend that this term is an axiomatic constant.
* Since `has_zero.zero` is a projection, it tries to reduce the major premise, which is `nat.has_zero`.
* Since `nat.has_zero` is a definition, it is unfolded, to `@has_zero.mk.{0} nat nat.zero`.
* Since `has_zero.mk` is a constructor, unfolding stops.
* Now we have `@has_zero.zero.{0} nat (@has_zero.mk.{0} nat nat.zero)`, which is a projection applied to a constructor, so it iota reduces to `nat.zero`.
* We now have to show `nat.zero =?= nat.zero`, so we are done.

Those constants are written in C++; they hook into the elaborator code for defeq and unification

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 14:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131995076):
They are not any different from other meta constants, but when you `#eval` a meta constant it checks if it has builtin code for the constant
```
meta constant foo : nat
#eval foo
-- code generation failed, VM does not have code for 'foo'
#eval (undefined : nat)
-- undefined
```

the `DECLARE_VM_BUILTIN` function in C++ hooks a C++ function to a meta constant by name, so if you want to find out what function handles `unify`, say, you can just look for this in the code

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 12 2018 at 14:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131995218):
Is there a formal definition of "axiomatic constant"? I thought `eq` was a Pi type and `nat.zero` was a constructor. They're also both constants somehow?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 14:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131995229):
`eq` has *type* `Π {α : Sort u}, α → α → Prop` but it has no *definition*

similarly `nat.zero : nat` but `nat.zero :=` nothing

yes there is a formal definition. These are both constants introduced through the declaration of an inductive type. If you recall each inductive type comes axiomatically with a type (being declared), a list of constructors, and a recursor

the important part is that this is a way to introduce constants that have no definition

technically the projections are defined in terms of the recursor, with a major premise like `(\lam x y z, y)`, and it's an iota reduction and some betas to get to where I said

got it -- so have I now

right, the pretty printer prints `nat.zero` as `0`. Which is actually kind of confusing since that would usually be reserved for `@has_zero.zero _ _`

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 12 2018 at 15:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%60a%20%3D%20b%20%3A%3D%20rfl%60/near/131996904):
So it's all happening too fast -- `whnf` turns `xena.zero` straight into `nat.zero` like `#reduce`?

right, `whnf` unfolds definitions until it reaches something which isn't a definition

it is similar to `#reduce`, but it doesn't reduce everything, only stuff at the head

for example:
```lean
run_cmd whnf `(λ x : ℕ, xena.zero) >>= trace -- λ (x : nat), xena.zero
```

`d.value` seems to have type `expr bool.tt`. What's that bool doing there?

the idea is that if `e1` unfolds to `sum A B` and `e2` unfolds to `prod C D`, then it is impossible for `e1 == e2`

even if `A B C D` are not completely unfolded

What does `==` mean?

It's different to `=` because if two things are equal they must have the same type.

it's not heq, I should use a better notation

defeq things have to have the same type btw

`expr tt` is `expr` and `expr ff` is `pexpr`

they have the same definition as inductive types so this saves some duplication

```lean
run_cmd do
  e ← mk_const ``xena.zero,

woo I wrote something that worked.
