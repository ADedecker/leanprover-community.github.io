I'm attempting to assert whether two elements of a list are equal, and then act on that assertion in an `if-then-else` manner, but for my `x = y` assertion, there is no `decidable` instance. Perhaps there's a different approach I ought to be taking?

Using the line `local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable` should help, but it will stop your functions being computable. What type do `x` and `y` have? You could also make `[decidable_eq Î±]` an argument to your function, if it's defined on an arbitrary type.

Thanks! `decidable_eq` is what I was looking for! I'd written this in Haskell first, and was of course using `Eq a => ...`.
