Is that a bug?
```lean
import tactic.ring

example (a b x y : â„¤) :  -x*y*(a+b)^2 + y*(x+y)*a^2 + x*(x+y)*b^2 - (a*y-b*x)^2 = 0:=
begin
  ring,
  ring,
end
```

so `ring` is not idempotent ^^

`ring` has a bug in it currently

I think there's an issue for it

The example in the issue actually works here

It's because when `ring` fails, it tries to rewrite the expression into a "nice" SOP form, and this rewriting causes it to circumvent the bug the second time around

`begin ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana_phone end`

I really mean: I copy and paste the example in the github issue and it works here
