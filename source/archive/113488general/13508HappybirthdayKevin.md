I'm no expert, but I think that modular forms were among the projects done here

I mentioned on the chat earlier today that I was going to have a day off work, but I didn't say why. I am 50 today (I have been for ten minutes in fact), which some people think is a big deal. I've spent so much time over the last few months just doing basic number theory / topology with random undergraduates many of whom do not even speak on this forum, I've had a really good time, it's meant that I've got behind on so many things but honestly Lean has changed my life for the better and I'm so pleased to be involved. Oh wow so much stuff I didn't know about!

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 21 2018 at 01:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134344359):

This is just ridiculous, there is stuff here. It should all go in the "what's new in Lean maths" thread.

Nobody ever gives me anything for my birthday, it is not taken at all seriously around here. I just get a new pair of trousers from my partner and that's it :-)

I would never dream of hurrying you. Sometimes people have to wait. Patrick really wants perfectoids done but I was talking to Chris over lunch and confessing that I was skipping lemmas about valuations because even though they "should be there", I wasn't going to put them there until we needed them. Chris said that this wasn't really the way to write Lean code. But if I write it properly Patrick will have to wait even longer. That's why ultimately I decided to start at the top to find out how many sorrys there are. Maybe I can even estimate how much work is left, in some sense. But as you once said, it's an open source project, people work on it when they can.

#### [Mario Carneiro (Sep 21 2018 at 01:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134345161):

Thank you Johan for the post on the "what's new" stream and thank you all of you for the repo. I am overwhelmed. You inspired me to write this: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/311071/which-mathematical-definitions-should-be-formalised-in-lean

@**Kevin Buzzard** Thanks for writing that question on mathoverflow. I am really excited and I look forward to the reactions.

How much of that is already done in formal abstracts?

That's a really good suggestion. I think Hales' definition had sorries. Oh -- the issue is the analytic continuation. Convergence shouldn't be hard for the experts *now we have exp* :-)

nice to see pi there -- I heard we had that.

But this is just real log we need; complex exp but real log.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 21 2018 at 14:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134374059):
So we need that exp is strictly increasing and continuous, and enough analysis to show that it yields a bijection between the reals and the positive reals.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 21 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134375090):
Yeah, this is an example of how it's tricky to say exactly what it means to define something. What Hales has done here is define a function `Î¶` which, "externally", we can prove is equal to the usual zeta function.
Actually he only did this assuming a couple axioms, but the axioms are easy to avoid--just define `Î¶` in terms of the axioms if they are true, and define it to be 37 if they are false.
This sort of thing already happened implicitly where he defined `exp` as a `tsum` and `real.log` as a `sup`--there are side conditions that you need here to make sure that you defined what you expected to define.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 21 2018 at 14:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134375890):
So the first goal is to give a sorry-free definition of an explicit function from C -> C which away from s = 1 agrees with the Riemann zeta function, possibly after invoking known mathematical theorems. Can we make it computable?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 21 2018 at 14:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134375893):

I don't want to spam my own MO post with my own answers, this isn't an exercise in self-advertisement, it's a research proposal.

Right, I don't think you should spam it. But we shouldn't spam it either... I'dd be very interested in what "tabula rasa" mathematicians come up with. I might post something tomorrow.

Chris had only just finished pi in time for the birthday surprise, but real log is almost there and complex log can be done with a bit more work. See https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/subject/sine.20and.20cosine.20and.20pi/near/134258931

@**Kevin Buzzard** Wow, I think the response to your mathoverflow post is really positive! I expected a lot (a lot!) more skepticism from the community. Maybe mathoverflow isn't completely representative. But still, I really like this. Apart from the thing about Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory all the other proposals are actually nice (somewhat ambitious) and realisable.

The post has an immense rate of upvotes (a lot faster then your post about perfectoids in Lean). And the post doesn't even mention that you are turning 50 today :grinning:

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 21 2018 at 19:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Happy%20birthday%2C%20Kevin%21/near/134390810):
Johan I would like to personally thank you for your idea about pi, and also Patrick for your suggestion about the T_2 project. I am still really flattered and stunned, and really touched. I think everyone should try to formalise one of their theorems. I don't understand formal abstracts. Are they waiting for Lean 4 or what? I don't have any unrealistic ambitions. I'm not thinking that in 1 year we will have Lean 4 with the global Langlands conjectures. But all this internet noise I'm trying to make today is because I want to train mathematicians *right now*, so we are ready to deal with what what might be the huge task of porting Mathlib to Lean 4. Johannes is leaving academia and Mario cannot do it alone. We need more volunteers and they need training. We have now seen that it takes one year to turn an incoming first year undergraduate into Chris Hughes or Kenny Lau. Let's make a few more of them with Lean 3.4.2 and worry about Lean 4 later. Let's see what we can do with a first year PhD student. There are plenty of other things to worry about before Lean 4. For example categories and canonical isomorphisms / transport de structure. Lean 4 is not magically going to solve those, or at least I don't think it is.

My pleasure! It was a lot of fun to work on these projects behind your back. But really @**Chris Hughes** deserves an insane amount of credit. He did all the hard work on `exp` and `pi` all by himself.
