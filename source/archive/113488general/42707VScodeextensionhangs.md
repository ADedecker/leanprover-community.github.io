Tonight VScode refuses to let me use lean. I have code that compiles fine using the command line lean, but in VScode orange side bars stay for a very long time before having `excessive memory consumption`

Is there any way one can check Lean version from VScode?

Hum, I removed lean from my old before-elan place and VScode doesn't find it anymore

Damnit. I had a Lean path hardcoded in VScode
