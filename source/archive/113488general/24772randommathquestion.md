so, seeing as how there are many mathematicians here, can anyone recommend a textbook on algebraic topology? I'd like to be able to read https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04443.pdf

Hatcher, of course

(your pdf is still loading, wait)

@**Andrew Ashworth** Hatcher Chapter 2

thanks, i'll check it out

@**Andrew Ashworth** Are you taking on Machine Learning as a hobby? I've been contemplating getting literate in the domain. There seems to be a lot to be done there. I'm curious about proving security / safety properties in those systems but I still don't know where to start

#### [Andrew Ashworth (Mar 31 2018 at 21:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463160):
hopefully more than a hobby once i learn more about it

#### [Andrew Ashworth (Mar 31 2018 at 21:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463162):
i work in imaging and radar

are you looking for textbook recommendations? that's where i started off

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463174):
Interesting. ML must be useful but tricky thing to use there

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463176):
Yes, thanks!

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463216):
how would you name the groups that can be generated by a set that injects to S?

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463217):
as in, name them in Lean

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463225):
What is S?

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463226):
a random set

i'd start off with the elements of statistical learning

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463269):
@**Simon Hudon** I just need a short name

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463270):
you know

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463275):
So when you say "injects" I assume you have an injective function from S to S?

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463276):
Actually, if you show me the construction, that would help me find a name for it

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463278):
I mean, a group G is inside my structure if it is generated by a set T with an injection from T to S

#### [Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463328):
Ok, that's clearer. Is that group interesting because of your choice of `S` and then the group basically says that the set `T` exists and is the set underlying `G`?

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463372):
```
structure to_be_named (G : Type u) [group G] :=
( gen : set G )
( gen_gen : group.generate gen = set.univ )
( func : gen â†’ S )
( inj : function.injective func )

Thanks! Do you plan on doing some ML in Lean?

#### [Kenny Lau (Mar 31 2018 at 21:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463515):
@**Simon Hudon** do you have any suggestions?

#### [Andrew Ashworth (Mar 31 2018 at 21:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463516):
that would be really hard without a good way of handling algebra and probability

#### [Andrew Ashworth (Mar 31 2018 at 21:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463520):
er, by algebra i mean matrices
