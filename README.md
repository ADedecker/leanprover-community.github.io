This is a static website, generated by Jekyll, for the [Lean proof assistant](https://leanprover.github.io) community. See the site at <https://leanprover-community.github.io>.

The site includes a static archive of the [leanprover Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/). This archive is generated by a [script](https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/master/import.py) that builds a local cache of the Zulip chat and updates it periodically.

This script can be easily modified to work for other Zulip chats. See <https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive>.

The [Jekyll simple style](https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple) is thanks to [wild-flame](https://wild-flame.github.io/).
