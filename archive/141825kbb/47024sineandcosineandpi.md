I've started working on sine and cosine. I have cleaned the proofs up until `exp (x + y)` and I'm currently working on things like `sin (x + y)`. I have no idea how to define pi however. @**Mario Carneiro** what's the best way to do this?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 13:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134009489):
Do you have complex exp or only real?

#### [ Chris Hughes (Sep 15 2018 at 14:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134010115):
complex. I'll define real.exp in terms of complex.exp

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011693):
Ok, so `sin (x + y)` and friends follow immediately from `exp(x+y)`.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011700):
You're such a mathematician.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011706):
Remember that you get a `/2` in those expressions. You need to convince Lean that you aren't dividing by zero.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011751):
But Chris is pushing progress to the `exp` branch on community mathlib

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011752):
For `pi` you can prove that cos vanishes somewhere between 0 and 2 using the intermediate value theorem, and define pi as twice the first zero of cos. This is cheap but I guess proving other properties from that is painful. A better solution is probably to prove the classification of subgroups of (R, +), and define 2pi as the positive generator of ker(t mapsto exp(i*t)) (this kernel cannot be dense because exp is continuous and non-constant)

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011758):
Rights, so we need continuity of `exp`.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011759):
For either definition.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011760):
I both cases yes

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011807):
What is the best way to do this continuity proof?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011809):
Generalise to arbitrary power series?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011813):
We could also cheat and define pi using a random series, but then the link with exp and cos would be harder to establish

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011817):
I like your second definition.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011821):
We should probably just check what Coq/Mizar/Isabelle do

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011825):
If you have $$e^{x+y} = e^x e^y$$ then it suffices to show that $$e^x$$ is continuous at 0, and for this you can use a crude bound on the power series.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011879):
Ok, sounds good.

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 15:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011923):
Patrick, you still have to prove that $$e^{it} = 1$$ for some nonzero real $$t$$ first, right?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134011977):
indeed we must exclude that the kernel is trivial

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 15:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012154):
Does the definition of pi really rely on some explicit estimate like $$\cos 2 < 0$$? 
I guess if you have differential calculus at your disposal, you could show that $$\sin t$$ is bounded, and then conclude that $$\cos t$$ cannot be positive everywhere... wait no, I don't even see how to make this work.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012167):
https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL/Transcendental.html seems to use my first method

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 15:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012218):
Okay--if $$\cos t$$ was positive everywhere then $$\sin t$$ would be increasing, and then $$\cos t$$ would have to lie below some line of negative slope, a contradiction.
Not sure if one can extract an "elementary" (no differential calculus) proof along these lines.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012328):
This all looks super tedious

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012331):
Let's do perfectoid spaces

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012706):
Hmmm, @**Reid Barton** I can easily follow your maths proof that `exp` is continuous if it is ctu at `0`.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012709):
But how do I put this into Lean?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012791):
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/topological_structures.lean#L289 may help

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012906):
Aah thanks, that indeed looks useful.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012930):
Do we know that `(exp x) \ne 0`?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 15:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012932):
It's not yet merged in mathlib, but doesn't depend on much

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 15:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012936):
Because then we know that `exp` is a group hom, which might also help.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Sep 15 2018 at 15:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134012999):
We do know exp \ne 0

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013589):
Hmmm, I'm horrible with these continuity proofs...

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013597):
So there is `squeeze_zero`, but I don't think there is a generic squeeze lemma, right?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 16:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013604):
there is

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013612):
Ooh, my VScode didn't find it.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013653):
Let me try again

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013665):
Aah, it only has squeeze in its docstring

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013667):

grep for squeeze also works

but grep for gendarme doesn't work

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013912):
Hmm snap, of course that doesn't help for continuity of the complex version.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 16:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134013997):
Anyway, the long term reasoning is clear: we don't want a trick, we want general results on power series

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014067):
Right. And I think I'dd rather work on the long term

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014074):
So, should we create `power_series.lean` on cocalc?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014085):
Maybe Kevin will see it. I think I don't care

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014151):
Is that ok with others? Then we could multiplayer power series into existence.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014152):
I'm quite addicted to that experience.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 15 2018 at 16:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014192):
I would wait until @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl** tells us about how this is done in Isabelle (they have a lot of analysis there)

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014543):
I will take a look

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014907):
So, continuity of `exp` is proved using derivability. There is a section "Term-by-Term Differentiability of Power Series" in http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL/Transcendental.html where most of it is proved. The central part is `termdiffs` which states: `DERIV (Î»x. ân. c n * x^n) x :> (ân. (diffs c) n * x^n)`.  Where `diffs c := (Î»n. of_nat (Suc n) * c (Suc n))` (`Suc` is `nat.succ` and `of_nat` is the coercion nat to a real_algebra).

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134014963):
The lemma `termdiffs` assumes that various power series converge.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015048):
So it would make sense to define power series, and then we need to change the definition of exp to use those power series.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015049):
Is that right?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015051):
I mean, there won't change that much

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015240):
Yes, I think it would make sense to define power series. Also derivatives...

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015325):
Ok, and this is purely algebraic stuff, right?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 16:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015338):
Or do you also mean the analytic derivative?

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Sep 15 2018 at 16:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015355):
I guess we need to analytic derivative to prove continuity

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 15 2018 at 17:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134015413):

And we really need all of this to define pi?

Well, we will need this stuff anyway

In Isabelle:
`pi = 2 * (THE x. 0 â¤ x â§ x â¤ 2 â§ cos x = 0)`

Right, so we need continuity

it also uses derivative of `cos` and that `sin 2 > 0`

I just pushed a load of stuff to the `exp` branch of community mathlib. It's about as far as I can go without continuity of `exp` and I'm not sure what the best approach for that is.

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 15 2018 at 21:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/sine%20and%20cosine%20and%20pi/near/134023255):
@**Chris Hughes** In metamath we used a very low brow approach to exp (it comes before analysis), which I think worked quite well.
* I assume you already have things like the addition formula and other algebraic stuff on sin and cos.
* `exp` is continuous iff it is continuous at each point. By facts about multiplying functions continuous at a point, you can show that it suffices to prove `exp` is continuous at zero.
* `1 + x <= exp x` for positive `x` by taking away the rest of the summands; `exp x <= 1/(1-x)` by comparing the infinite series of these two. Thus `exp` is continuous and even differentiable at zero by the sandwich lemma.
* It follows from basic topological ring action that `sin` is continuous.
* `pi` is the infimum of the positive zeros of the `sin` function. We need to show this is well defined and a zero of the sin function.
* Suppose `a` is a zero of `sin` in the range `(2,4)`, and `b` is a positive zero of sin. Show that if `pi < a` then `(pi + a) / 2 <= b`, because `2*a - b` is also a zero of `sin`.
* By the intermediate value theorem applied to `sin`, and `sin 2 > 0` and `sin 4 < 0`, there is a zero `a` in this range, and `pi` exists. if `pi < a`, then `(pi + a) / 2 <= pi` by the above lemma, since `pi` is the infimum of all positive roots of sin. Thus `a <= pi` and thus `pi` is the unique zero of sin in this range.

For the bounds:
* `sin 4 = 2 * sin 2 * cos 2` is negative because `sin 2` is positive and `cos 2` is negative
* `-7/9 < cos 2 < -1/9` because `cos 2 = 2 * (cos 1)^2 - 1` and `1/3 < cos 1 < 2/3`
* `sin (2*x)` is positive for all `0<x<=1` because `sin x` and `cos x` are
* `x - x^3/3 < sin x < x` and `1 - 2/3 * x^2 < cos x < 1 - x^2/3` on `(0, 1]` by infinite series bounds

By the way, metamath used to have a direct proof before analysis was developed, but now continuity of exp follows from differentiability, and continuity uses various topological notions and proofs. I think the definition of `exp` can be in `data.{real,complex}.basic`, but `pi` and other facts that depend on continuity should go in the topological part, at `analysis.{real,complex}`

if x<y and f(x)<0 and f(y)>0, then {t | f(t) < 0} and {t | f(t) > 0} are two disjoint open subsets of [x,y]. Since [x,y] is connected, the union of those two sets can't be the entirety of [x,y], so there must be something not belonging to those two sets, i.e. t such that f(t) = 0

This comes fairly late in the development.
* First you do the real log function. exp is easily seen to be increasing so you get an inverse by IVT. I can expand on this
* `sin` is a bijection from [-pi/2, pi/2] to [-1, 1]. Again, this has subparts
* Injectivity of `exp`: `exp x = 1` iff `x = 2*pi*i*n` for some `n`
* The complex square root function exists. You can define it as `sqrt z = sqrt (abs z) * ((abs z + z) / abs (abs z + z))` off the negative real axis
* If `D` is an interval of length 2pi, and `y : D` is chosen to be a multiple of 2 pi from `2 * arcsin (im (sqrt z))`, then `z = exp (I * y)`, which shows surjectivity of the imaginary part
* By combining surjectivity on real and imaginary parts and injectivity, you get that `exp` is bijective in any domain of the form `{z | z.im \in D}`

do you need bounds on sine 1 and use cos^2 + sin^2 = 1

The claim is that `abs (cos x - (1 - x^2 / 2)) < x^2 / 6` for `x \in (0, 1]`. By the `m=4` case of the tail bound on exp, `cos x - (1 - x^2 / 2) = re (exp4 (I*x)) <= abs (exp4 (I*x)) <= x^4 * ((4 + 1) / (4! * 4)) < x^4 / 6 <= x^2 / 6`, where `exp4` is the tail of `exp` starting at 4.

I think there is a theorem that `re` is a contracting map, which is enough to prove continuity

I managed to work it out. I thought there was some simple proof without deltas, but deltas is really short anyway.

More or less there. Just have to apply IVT which I have already proved.

well sin(pi/2)=1 implies cos(pi/2)=0...

but it looks like he proved `cos (pi/2) = 0`, which only implies `sin(pi/2) = +- 1`
