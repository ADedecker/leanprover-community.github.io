Welcome to #**kbb**.

This is a test: can anyone hear me?

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758301):
Yes

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758347):
Does anyone has another Zulip account and could check what is visible?

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758350):
I thought about this, but I'm not sure whether the stream would be visible to external people. Yeah

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 22:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758362):
Or, just remove me temporarily.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758428):
Funnily, I don't seem to be allowed to do that

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 11 2018 at 22:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758563):
I see you

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758631):
I'm creating another account

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 11 2018 at 22:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758642):
Also: this is a great idea

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 11 2018 at 22:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758677):
Did you need the help of an administrator to create this stream?

No

I think this stream is safe

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758814):
The point is that group PM is not suitable for what we were doing. That generates too many notifications

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 11 2018 at 22:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758822):
Amen

Reid, do you see things here?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133758983):
Reid should be back in

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759031):
Yep, I am now.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759034):
And should see the full history, which is another advantage compared to group PM

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759035):
Indeed I can

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759037):
(this was an option when creating the stream)

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759059):
Ok, let's stop using the group PM and its endless series of emails and notification popups

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 11 2018 at 22:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133759082):

What's the story of `fast_matrix`? Is it fast to compute because it uses `vector`? Or is it only fast to type because of the notation?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 12 2018 at 04:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133773618):

Shouldn't this go into a new thread :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 12 2018 at 04:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133773678):
To answer your question: `fast_matrix` is now obsolete, since @**Jack Crawford** pushed an implementation that is a lot more fleshed out. His implementation is both supposed to be faster to compute with and easier to type. You can use the equation compiler to grab the `a b c d` out of a `2x2` matrix, which makes for readable definitions.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 12 2018 at 04:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133773689):
Also: very good idea to create a private stream. I didn't know this was possible. We should have done that 1 week ago.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 12 2018 at 04:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/133773735):
The cool side effect is that we can give Kevin access, and he can read through the history of all of our discussions :lol:

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 16 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134046203):
ok so we have 4 days left

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 16 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134046204):
can we come up with a realistic list of goals

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 16 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134046205):
or a list of realistic goals?

Mario, do you see anything in this repo that could hope to get into mathlib?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 06:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134078972):
Like I said, I'll be gone on Wednesday, so I can only contribute today and tomorrow.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 06:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134079018):
I think either: we start cleaning up; or we focus on the Hecke operator (on the complex vector space (=module :lol:) of modular forms.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 06:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134079020):
This second option will probably force us to clean up other stuff as well.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 06:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134079029):
Otoh, we could also leave the modular form part of the repo as it is.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 06:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134079032):
And then we could focus all our time on `exp` and friends.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 08:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134148818):
:bell: We have 99 commits in the `kbb` repository! Well done to everyone who contributed!

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 10:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134153709):
What's the status of the Hecke operator file? I don't even understand the maths here. What is the meaning of the first displayed formula at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_operator#Explicit_formula? Is each term in the sum meant to be well defined? Or only the sum? If I naively try to change (a b c d) by multiplication by a element of SL2Z and use the weight formula for f, I don't seem to get the same term.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154192):
You should get the same term, right? Or did I mess something up. I was quite convinced that every term in the sum was well-defined.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154220):
But maybe we should just delete this file... I think I aimed to high.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154275):
I don't understand the wikipedia page, so you don't need to mess up anything

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154286):
What is the pen and paper proof that each term in the sum is well-defined?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154293):
I must be missing something obvious

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154358):
$$(cz + d)^{-k} f(\frac{az + b}{cz + d}) = (cz + d)^{-k} f(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}z)$$, is that right?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154363):
yes

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154371):
So now we take another representative: $$M\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154396):
The trouble is that $$a, b, c, d \mapsto  (cz+d)$$ is not a group morphism

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154440):
Hmm, I'm also getting myself confused.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154477):
If that were a group morphism then everything would be obviously ok

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154523):
Too bad we can't ask Kevin

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 18 2018 at 11:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154565):
It shouldn't be a group morphism, it should be a 1-cocycle, or something. Right? Because $$z$$ is changing too

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154612):
oh yes, z is changing

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154613):
I think it's not changing enough on my paper

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154825):
Ok, it works now

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154829):
You can continue to do number theory, it's alright

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154857):
It was only a stupid copy-paste mistake

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154934):
It also works on my paper

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154945):
So, we've proven it! Let's move on to the next maths theorem (-;

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154949):
It shouldn't be that hard to Lean (modulo those f***ing cast and coes)

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154962):
Right, Kenny did a lot of useful stuff (-;

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154965):
But all those actions of matrices on each other, and on the upper half plane...

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134154969):
That's going to be quite a pain.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134155112):
@**Patrick Massot** Are you willing to take a shot at it?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134155121):
I may try in the afternoon

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156129):
I cleaned up a tiny bit but several things are weird. First I cannot sorry the proof. Lean complains there are remaining meta-variables, but I don't see where. And I have an hypothesis `H: A ≈ B` that I found no way to destruct into the existence of P in SL2 such that B = PA. This is not such a suprise because the beginning of the proof is really a mess

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 11:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156173):
I think this is a very bad start. @**Johannes Hölzl** could you have a look?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156261):
Right... my brain stopped working after I wrote the start of that file. Guess why...

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 18 2018 at 12:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156613):
@**Patrick Massot** where should I look? I have no idea what a Hecke operator is. Did you push your commits, I don't see anything in kbb.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156640):
There is a file called `Hecke_operator` or something

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156648):

To prove that the sum is over a finite set, we need to use the stuff that you cleaned up.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 18 2018 at 12:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156734):
Hm, the statements shouldn't change, besides `reduce_def` which is now `reduce_eq1`, `reduce_eq2, `reduce_eq3`.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134156921):
Right, line 12 should be
```lean

```

@**Johannes Hölzl** Now you can have a look, sorry about the false start

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158356):
I'm a bit scared about the fact that we only know that `SL2Z_H` is a group action.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158362):
It seems like we would want to know that `MAT2_H` is a monoid action.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158374):
Oh yes, we need that

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158376):
But refactoring `SL2Z` into a subtype of `MAT2` give me a headache

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158378):
I thought this was the reason you put det > 0 everywhere instead of det = 1

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158379):
Because that means we have to go through all of Kenny's code again

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158385):
And this is why I don't understand how term mode code could be easier to maintain

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158428):
They set things up in the correct way the first time.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158435):
No, that's not what refactoring means

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158436):
Instead of me: I only get it right after 42 attemts.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158439):
You're right.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158448):
But I agree that it is really confusing that we can not unfold that equivalence between `A` and `B`

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 12:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134158453):
After we have that, we could try to just battle on.

@**Johannes Hölzl** So we have two problems: (1) how do we unfold the equivalence in `hecke_operator.lean`.

By definition `A` and `B` are equivalent if there is an `M : SL2Z` such that `A = MB`.

And (2), to get a readable (and workable) version of the Hecke operator, it would be good to have `A • z` where `A` is any 2x2-matrix with integer coefficients, and `z : ℍ`.

It's interesting to know how far one should be allowed to go into definition cheating. Say I want to prove RH in Lean. I define the usual zeta, call it zeta', and then define zeta(z) to be zeta'(z) if z is not a surprising zero of zeta', and one otherwise. Then I prove RH, and all is left is proving my definition of zeta is equivalent to the usual one...

That is so funny. That is a fine abstract to formalise. It would be trivial if there was a half-decent API for modular forms, and Lean is perfect for that sort of thing.

You could formalise a mathematically equivalent statement more easily -- the eigenvalues of a Hecke operator on a space of modular forms are the same as the eigenvalues of a corresponding Hecke operator on a certain group cohomology group, by a theorem of Eichler and Shimura. Formalising group cohomology would perhaps be easier than formalising modular forms -- I'm not really sure but it sounds easier to me. Group cohomology is just there waiting to be done.

I wrote that paper after hearing a talk of Dinakar Ramakrishnan, when he mentioned that he had never seen a modular eigenform whose Hecke eigenvalues generated a non-solvable extension of the rationals. Talking to him afterwards it became clear that this was only because there were no computer programs to compute modular forms, and that we all knew exactly where to look. I took the trouble to look and there they were. Dinakar urged me to write it up.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 21 2018 at 13:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134371722):
We are not so far away from having Hecke operators (they almost act on functions of a fixed weight, and it shouldn't be so hard to show they act on holomorphic functions and preserve boundedness at infinity). We also have characteristic polynomial, and Johannes has been working towards Galois groups. But we mostly gave up when Johan pointed out that we would need that modular forms of a fixed weight form a finite dimensional subspace of holomorphic functions (we do have a vector space structure on holomorphic functions on the upper half plane).

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 22 2018 at 11:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134430430):
aie, yes, finite-dimensionality is needed. A trivial consequence of the fact that the global sections of a line bundle on a compact Riemann surface are finite-dimensional, so `by maths_undergraduate` should do it. I'm going to try and build that tactic at Imperial.

Finite-dimensionality for the group cohomology would be a trivial consequence of the fact that a finite index subgroup of a finitely-generated group is finitely-generated, and the fact that SL(2,Z) is finitely-generated. I don't know how easy it is to prove the finite index result just by group theory, I am no algebraist. The proofs I know are topological. The group cohomology variant would be provably equal once we had something like Stokes' theorem.

Right. But for finite-dimensionality of the cohomology group for general levels we'll need that a finite index subgroup of a f.g. group is f.g. But I see what you're saying -- this is enough to prove that level 1 modular forms are finite-dimensional.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 22 2018 at 13:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/hello/near/134434419):
There is some kind of subtlety which I have only recently become aware of, and again it was a comment of @**Reid Barton** which clarified things for me. Without some general theory of global sections of line bundles on compact Riemann surfaces it's kind of a pain to prove that the space of modular forms is finite-dimensional. But it is finite-dimensional, so one can define the char poly of a Hecke operator to be "if the space is infinite-dimensional then 37, and if it's finite-dimensional then the char poly". This gives a sorry-free way of defining the char poly which is human-provably equivalent to the right thing. What one *cannot* do is to get away without defining the Hecke operator at all and just sorrying it -- because then the char poly has a sorry in too.

One of the things I realise I want now is for a bunch of mathematicians to come along and say "can you formalise theorem X or definition Y in Lean?" because questions such as that are ways of discovering what kind of an API a normal mathematician (perhaps with no Lean training) wants. Who cares about proofs, they are too hard. I know that Mario feels that a definition is pointless without an application. How about if the application is some statements of theorems or conjectures?
