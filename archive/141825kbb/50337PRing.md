I'm a little bit lost:
* is @**Kenny Lau** 's `Sym` related to @**Chris Hughes**' `group_theory.perm`?
* do we need `computable_matrix`? there are a lot of definitions, do we need them now? I think we should think about this before we add them,
* `determinants` looks mostly good to me (modulo some naming, e.g. `finset.prod_mul_right`)
* `holomorphic_function`: I guess we can add `complex_derivative` and generalize it later?
* `matrices` is this Sean's version?
* `monoid_stuff` is good
* it would be good if all files get a header who was involved in them

`matrices` is indeed Sean's version.

I'm not sure if we need `computable_matrix` just now.

good

@**Johannes Hölzl** Thanks for this feedback.

What do you think of `modular_group` and `SL2Z_generators`? I guess those are "tricky" files...

`modular_group` look tidy to me. But I don't know a lot about the theory behind it

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Sep 17 2018 at 11:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/PRing/near/134090887):
I don't know why some names end in an underscore like `SL2Z_M_`?

`SL2Z_generators` has some ugly proofs in it... I hope we can simplify them...

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 17 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/141825-kbb/topic/PRing/near/134095618):
Hmm, the I am the one how wrote those underscore definitions. I cannot really give a precise reason for why I do it, but it is somehow intended to convey that the first argument is sort "fixed".

Like the $$p$$ in $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$
