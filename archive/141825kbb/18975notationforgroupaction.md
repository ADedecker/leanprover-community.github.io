I think we should just group actions an instance of `has_smul`. What do others think?

it *probably* won't cause problems

And then we get `group_module G A` with an instance to `module (group_ring G) A` and we will have to versions of `has_smul` :scream:

Ooo, I guess it just means we will always have to explicitly write the coercion `G â†’ (group_ring G)` to distinguish which action we mean.
