This is a thread to discuss the merits of `SL2Z` compared to the other 2 implementations that are available. @**Mario Carneiro** @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl** Could you see something like `SL2Z` end up in mathlib, or would you suggest that `matrix (fin 2) (fin 2) int` or `computable_matrix 2 2 int` be used instead?
