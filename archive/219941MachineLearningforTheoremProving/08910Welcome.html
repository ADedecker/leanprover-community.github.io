<p>I've created this stream as a place to discuss AI and machine learning for theorem proving.  I put it in the Lean Zulip because this is a great and vibrant community, and I think there is a strong desire to try out machine learning in Lean.  However, my hope is that this can be a common place to talk about AI &amp; ML for TP beyond Lean as well.  For example, a number of us have been having deep conversations about <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/holist/home" target="_blank" title="https://sites.google.com/view/holist/home">HOList</a>.  We've mapped out its gRPC API and have been discussing many of it's design decisions.  We'd love to open up this and other conversations to a wider audience.</p>
