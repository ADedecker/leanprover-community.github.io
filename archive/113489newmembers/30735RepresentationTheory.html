<p>I was reading through a Representation Theory textbook and a question came to my mind: Have the theory been implemented in any LEAN library?</p>

<p>No, there's essentially no representation theory at this point (although there is some commutative algebra).</p>

<p>Thank you for answering. If so, how much it will be worth (for this community) to implement the theory in a library? It's a classical theory, but the fact that it is not yet implemented seems to somewhat imply that there are more urgent needs for other theories now. I want to know the context if any exists.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242240">@Jineon Baek</span> It only somewhat implies that we don't have enough people power. It's a relatively small group of contributors, and they just hack on whatever they think is fun.</p>

<p>There are several people on this chat that think that representation theory is extremely important. But we just haven't got round to doing anything so far.</p>

<p>At some point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="220718">@Ben McDonnell</span> started working on some rep.theory. Maybe he can share what he's got so far somewhere.</p>
