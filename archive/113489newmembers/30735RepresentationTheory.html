<p>I was reading through a Representation Theory textbook and a question came to my mind: Have the theory been implemented in any LEAN library?</p>

<p>No, there's essentially no representation theory at this point (although there is some commutative algebra).</p>

<p>Thank you for answering. If so, how much it will be worth (for this community) to implement the theory in a library? It's a classical theory, but the fact that it is not yet implemented seems to somewhat imply that there are more urgent needs for other theories now. I want to know the context if any exists.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242240">@Jineon Baek</span> It only somewhat implies that we don't have enough people power. It's a relatively small group of contributors, and they just hack on whatever they think is fun.</p>

<p>There are several people on this chat that think that representation theory is extremely important. But we just haven't got round to doing anything so far.</p>

<p>At some point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="220718">@Ben McDonnell</span> started working on some rep.theory. Maybe he can share what he's got so far somewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, I'd love to see some! A lot depends on what generality you want to do things in, and often for mathlib the answer is "a lot of generality".</p>

<p>The theory of abelian categories is on the horizon, and might be useful to have in place, so if someone wants to work on that I'd be happy to provide some pointers (and get around to doing some of the things I promised to do).</p>

<p>But generally --- pick a (good) book, and have a go. :-)</p>

<p>I'd love to see someone start on Etingof's Representation Theory: <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/repb.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/repb.pdf">http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/repb.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the input everyone! I'm a newbie both in this lean game and representation theory, so I'm thinking of learning both by implementing theorems in a textbook as I learn them like the 'intro to proof' course project.</p>

<p>Full generality is definitely what standard library should aim for though. If my own little project works out well I'll share. Would happy to hear pointers for a starting point. I'm wondering if I should give it a try for finite group rep. with finite dimensional vector space first, or in a bit more generality.</p>

<p>Why not try to prove the first interesting thing about finite group representations: averaging over the group is the projection onto the trivial isotypic component?</p>

<ol>
<li>define the operator 1/|G| \Sigma_g g</li>
<li>prove that it is idempotent</li>
<li>prove that anything in its image is fixed by the group</li>
<li>prove that if you are fixed by every group element you are fixed by this operator</li>

<p>You'll need to see how to work with linear operators, and use <code>finset.sum</code> to handle the summations.</p>
