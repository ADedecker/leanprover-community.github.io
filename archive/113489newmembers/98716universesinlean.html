<p>I have tried to represent graphs and paths using inductive data type in lean.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/enharsha/Graphs-in-Lean/blob/master/graph.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/enharsha/Graphs-in-Lean/blob/master/graph.lean">https://github.com/enharsha/Graphs-in-Lean/blob/master/graph.lean</a><br>
However, while compiling definition of path, it shows the following error - "universe level of type_of(arg <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/3" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/3">#3</a>) of 'path.addedge' is too big for the corresponding inductive datatype". Could anyone help me out? I have referred to inductive types section in Theorem Proving in Lean, where vectors have been defined in a similar fashion.</p>
