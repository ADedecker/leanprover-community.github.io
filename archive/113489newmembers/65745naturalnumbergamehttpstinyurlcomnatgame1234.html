<p>Thanks. Now I'm stuck on world 3 level 11. In the first line I wrote</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">split</span><span class="o">,</span>
</pre></div>


<p>to split the iff into implications but I got a "tactic failed" error. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Note also that some error messages are being incorrectly suppressed in the version online at the minute. This is a bug which has been chased down and squashed but has not made it upstream.</p>

<p>Hi. I am in the process of learning lean. After going through the first 4 sections of theorem proving with lean, I decided to play the natural number game to learn about tactics. I just finished it and I enjoyed it very much. I was stuck at some points but managed to find some explanations about some tactics in the documentation that were not explained during the process of the game.</p>

<p>but I'll get there in the end :D Given the choice between organising an open day for potential PhD students and playing with the natural number game, I know which one I would rather be doing, but unfortunately I also know which one I have to be doing :-/</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="132175">Mohammad Pedramfar</span> I just looked at Bryan's screenshot above and I am a bit confused. The files he's reporting as not being able to see -- e.g. vs/loader.js -- they are there, but <code>-rw--r--r--</code> so my guess is that he can't see them because there's no <code>+x</code>. Is this a problem with our set-up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no problem with Bryan's screenshots. As he said, the missing files are debugging tools. They're not necessary.</p>

<p>the game works in chrome(after enabling cookies) :D, in edge it didn't, and in firefox it didn't load (no cookise enabled)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edge and IE are always different! I'm glad it's working now. I haven't had any problems with firefox before, if you have the screenshots of console output, I might be able to figure out what's going on.<br>
I'm glad it's finally working! :)</p>
