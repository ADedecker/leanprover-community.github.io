<p>You defined <code>consistent</code> as a Prop, and <code>and</code> expects a Prop. So why did you give it a <em>proof</em> and not a Prop? You gave it a term of type P, not P itself.</p>

<p>Ok, I think I'm getting this. It's working fine with the modification. Thank you!</p>

<p>PS your <code>import init</code> is bad -- remove it. Your <code>set_option class.instance_max_depth 15000000</code> is also bad -- remove it. I think the reasons were already explained above but you don't want either of these two lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right. I had forgotten to take those out since they weren't actively stopping my code from compiling... Thanks for the reminder!</p>

<p>Thank you! That's a good point that maybe this is a sign that I should switch to the mathlib representation. My other motivation for not switching was that eventually I want to start putting noncommutative elements (specifically entangled quantum states) into the matrix, so it would matter whether I'm ordering it by rows or columns. If we have <code>(M : fin m → fin n → ℕ )</code>, I guess I could also just transpose it and do <code>matrix_sum </code> on the transpose. This way we get both cases, and all I need is to show whether they're equal or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm now wanting to repeat this procedure but with matrices in each column instead of integers, and taking the matrix product of all the matrices in each row. <code>finset.univ.prod</code> (understandably) doesn't use <code>matrix.mul</code> automatically when its input is a matrix. Is there a way to feed it an arbitrary function (à la MapReduce) , or should I be thinking about this differently? I could see a benefit to implementing this matrix data structure differently, maybe as a 2D linked list, to facilitate recursive matrix multiplication of its elements over a given row or column, but I feel like that shouldn't be necessary.</p>
