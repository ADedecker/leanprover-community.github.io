<p>Coq has the Search command which lets you look for theorems relevant to a particular term or a pattern or a string. For example one could run "Search list." and it would let you find the theorems available which involve "list".</p>
<p>What is the Lean equivalent of this?</p>

<p>There is <code>find</code> which seems to be less than optimal and doesn't get much love. Then there are the tactics <code>suggest</code> and <code>library_search</code> which might be more helpful if you are searching for one specific theorem (you know the type, but not the name).<br>
For a list of theorems involving <code>list</code>, I guess currently your best option is generic search tools like <code>grep</code>.</p>

<p>If you're using VS Code, you can access the Lean server's search feature by hiting ctrl (or cmd if on a mac) + p and then typing the <code>#</code> character before your search string. I think this searches all declarations either imported or in open files? Presumably the Emacs mode has access to this as well.</p>

<p>That's an <code>or</code> not an <code>either .. or</code></p>
