<p>Hello world!<br>
I played enough of the "number game" that I thought I should try something a bit different -- more in my area, and more advanced.</p>
<p>I checked that Lean has the concepts of group, and in particular finite groups, built-in. I was thinking about proving the following theorems, in order of difficulty:<br>
-- The group generated by x-&gt;x+1 acting on the reals is the free group &lt;a|&gt;<br>
-- The group generated by x-&gt;x+1 and x-&gt;2x has as presentation &lt;a,b|ab=ba^2&gt;<br>
-- The group generated by x-&gt;x+1 and x-&gt;x^3 is the free group &lt;a,b|&gt;</p>
<p>Any opinions on whether this is a sensible task for a newbie?</p>
<p>TIA, Laurent</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="263407">@Laurent Bartholdi</span> What exactly do you mean with "the group generated by x -&gt; x+1 and x -&gt; x^3"?</p>

<p>Are you fixing a real number, and then taking the closure under those functions?</p>

<p>Anyway, I think such statements can be done in Lean, although there might be some annoying technicalities.</p>

<p>There are two options. I could think about maps on the reals, and this is my preferred choice. I could also think of the orbit of \pi under these operations (assuming lean knows that \pi is transcendental, of course).</p>
