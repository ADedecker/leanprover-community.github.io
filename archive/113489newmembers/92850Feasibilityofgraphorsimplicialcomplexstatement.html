<p>I've very new, but I have one very specific question and one general question. (1) Say I had some proposition that came up about graphs (it's currently phrased in the language of Serre and his book on Trees) about paths/geodesics and how they "overlap", would lean be a reasonable place to try to prove it formally? (2) Is there a good source that maps the different proof languages to underlying type systems and compares them - in a way that a math person could read and then decide which is best?</p>

<p>re:Question 2, I'm a non-expert but I would be interested to know if say, system A did dependent types (or your-favorite-thing) and system B didn't. I'd be interested to just have an accurate mapping of which concepts go where even if I didn't understand them - but also interested in which things have practical considerations and which are totally theoretical.</p>

<p>nCatLab is occasionally abstruse but it's still very useful just because it names concepts and organizes them. Is there a similar thing in this area? <br>
I care about which things formally can do what but I'm also asking about the maturity of the libraries and the real human effectiveness</p>

<p>That said, if you just want to know what axiomatic system the various provers are using: Coq, Lean - CIC (dependent type theory); HOL, HOL4, HOL Light, Isabelle/HOL - HOL (simple type theory); Mizar, Metamath, Isabelle/ZF - ZFC (set theory); Agda, RedPRL, Cubicaltt, UniMath, NuPRL - specialized logics or HoTT variants</p>

<p>The most "mature" libraries are Coq, Isabelle, and Mizar; Lean is a newcomer but it has also learned from its predecessors in a lot of ways and is I think pretty nice to use</p>

<p>I suppose there is also Idris? <br>
This list helps!<br>
 I'm sort of hoping for me a 1-dimensional simplicial complex with boundary maps etc. will suffice for the graph (maybe this is even already done in lean) and I'll probably have to do my own work to define what I mean by path and some other data</p>
<p>I'd be interested if there were formal reasons to prefer dependent vs simple types but practically speaking it sounds like dependent+Lean is the way to go.</p>

<p>As Patrick says, there is nothing in theory to stop one from formalising all of Serre's book on trees in Lean. It would take some time though! I read all the earlier chapters once but I don't recall anything about geodesics.</p>

<p>With high probability they will use a different definition of "graph". IIRC the Lean Together 2020 talk was about finite graphs, and in Serre's book there are infinite trees all over the place.</p>

<p>You will be able to do it in Lean and Coq and Mizar, you may or may not be able to do it in Isabelle/HOL depending on whether you need dependent types or not (e.g. topological spaces don't need dependent types, sheaves on topological spaces do), and who knows whether you'll be able to do it in HoTT because the moment you ask someone about it they'll start talking about infinity-topoi :-(</p>

<p>I tried to implement a few things in graph theory, here <a href="https://github.com/vbeffara/lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/vbeffara/lean">https://github.com/vbeffara/lean</a> and went as far as proving that Cayley graphs of the same group are bilipschitz equivalent, and tried to define graph minors but what I did was very awkward all over. I would love to see what someone who knows what they are doing would write :-)</p>
<p>BTW, is there a canonical way to say "I wrote something that does not quite fit in a chat like here, is definitely PR material, and I would like to get some feedback"?</p>

<p>It is nice to be able to have them as a specialization of a cell-complex so you can cone off or add things but it depends on what you're doing. (I don't currently need it but having general cell-complex stuff implemented would be really neat)</p>
<p>For Serre a graph is a set of edges and vertices where you think of the edges as being directed. Formally there's a map called *  from E to E such that (e<em>)</em>=e and e* != e and a initial and terminal boundary map from E to V that satisfies b_initial(e)=b_terminal(e*)</p>

<p>With the <code>(V, E)</code> approach you'll have a lot of equality assumptions here and there, and you'll have to rewrite on them.

<p>It makes sense in many contexts to have <code>adj : V -&gt; V -&gt; W</code> for some labelling type <code>W</code> that would be <code>Prop</code> (or <code>bool</code> ? I seem to remember that in Coq it makes a huge difference for some reason, probably due to decidability/proof irrelevance/something) for usual graphs, but <code>W = \nat</code> gives multiplicity, probabilists like <code>W = nnreal</code>, computer scientists like to put a monoid there.</p>

<p>That seems to be what they do in Coq libraries, they have types for both vertices and edges rather than an adjacency relation IIRC</p>

<p>With the <code>(V, E)</code> approach you'll have a lot of equality assumptions here and there, and you'll have to rewrite on them. With the <code>edges : V → V → Sort v</code> approach you'll have troubles whenever you have <code>(x y y' z : V) (e : edges x y) (e' : edges y' z) (h : y = y') (f : Π x y z, edges x y → edges y z → α)</code> and want to write <code>f _ _ _ e e'</code>.</p>

<p>Path concatenation caused me some trouble with the <code>V -&gt; V -&gt; Prop</code> option (with a <code>Path x y</code> type), indeed. Still felt more manageable to me than the <code>(V,E)</code> version.</p>

<p>I'm doing that because lean told me I couldn't have <code>parameter</code>s outside a <code>section</code>. Does that mean that it is a bad idea to use <code>parameter</code>?</p>

<p>AFAIK <code>parameter</code>s will not work in Lean 4. Try <code>variable</code>s.</p>
