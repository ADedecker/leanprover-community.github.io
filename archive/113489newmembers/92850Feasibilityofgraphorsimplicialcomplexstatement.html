<p>I've very new, but I have one very specific question and one general question. (1) Say I had some proposition that came up about graphs (it's currently phrased in the language of Serre and his book on Trees) about paths/geodesics and how they "overlap", would lean be a reasonable place to try to prove it formally? (2) Is there a good source that maps the different proof languages to underlying type systems and compares them - in a way that a math person could read and then decide which is best?</p>

<p>but as a matter of course, everyone uses Isabelle/HOL and its tactics and they get an impression of the weakness of simple type theory from that</p>

<p>re:Question 2, I'm a non-expert but I would be interested to know if say, system A did dependent types (or your-favorite-thing) and system B didn't. I'd be interested to just have an accurate mapping of which concepts go where even if I didn't understand them - but also interested in which things have practical considerations and which are totally theoretical.</p>

<p>the real things to worry about are whether the prover gives you enough sugar to work with it effectively</p>

<p>nCatLab is occasionally abstruse but it's still very useful just because it names concepts and organizes them. Is there a similar thing in this area? <br>
I care about which things formally can do what but I'm also asking about the maturity of the libraries and the real human effectiveness</p>

<p>That said, if you just want to know what axiomatic system the various provers are using: Coq, Lean - CIC (dependent type theory); HOL, HOL4, HOL Light, Isabelle/HOL - HOL (simple type theory); Mizar, Metamath, Isabelle/ZF - ZFC (set theory); Agda, RedPRL, Cubicaltt, UniMath, NuPRL - specialized logics or HoTT variants</p>

<p>The most "mature" libraries are Coq, Isabelle, and Mizar; Lean is a newcomer but it has also learned from its predecessors in a lot of ways and is I think pretty nice to use</p>

<p>I suppose there is also Idris? <br>
This list helps!<br>
 I'm sort of hoping for me a 1-dimensional simplicial complex with boundary maps etc. will suffice for the graph (maybe this is even already done in lean) and I'll probably have to do my own work to define what I mean by path and some other data</p>
<p>I'd be interested if there were formal reasons to prefer dependent vs simple types but practically speaking it sounds like dependent+Lean is the way to go.</p>

<p>As Patrick says, there is nothing in theory to stop one from formalising all of Serre's book on trees in Lean. It would take some time though! I read all the earlier chapters once but I don't recall anything about geodesics.</p>

<p>With high probability they will use a different definition of "graph". IIRC the Lean Together 2020 talk was about finite graphs, and in Serre's book there are infinite trees all over the place.</p>
