<p>I am working on a little proof and need to rewrite <code>sqr (a - b)</code> into <code>sqr a - 2 * a * b + sqr b</code>. Now of course I could define a postulate for this like I did in the Agda proof I am rewriting, but I am guessing that this is proven in the <code>mathlib</code> and Lean has some kind of proof search. In Coq I could write something like <code>Search (forall a b, sqr (a - b) = sqr a - 2 * a * b + sqr b).</code> What functionality for this sort of thing does Lean have?</p>
