I'm trying to get more efficient in my proofs, so I want to learn about the wlog tactic, but I didn't understand the comments where the tactic was written. Are there any examples I can read (preferably about something I could understand)?

Not to derail your question entirely, but I also recently had issues trying to understand the comments. In particular, it started with the [summary](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/57194fa57e76721a517d6969ee88a6007f0722b3/tactic/wlog.lean#L111):

```quote
Without loss of generality: reduces to one goal under variables permutations
```

What does “reduces to one goal under variables permutations” mean?

`wlog` applies when the goal is symmetric under permutation of some variables, and there is a "symmetry breaking" relation that holds when disjoined over all permutations

i.e. you want to prove `x * y <= 1`, then wlog you can assume `x <= y`

```lean
import tactic.wlog

example (x y : ℕ) : x * y ≤ 1 :=
begin
  wlog h : x ≤ y,
  -- x ≤ y ⊢ x * y ≤ 1
end
```

I agree the wording is not very good. I invite suggestions for rewording

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 12:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132101818):
The wlog I want to do is a little more complicated, for example I have `( p(a) \or p(b) )`, where `p` is a pseudo-order relation.  I also have stuff like `h1 : p(a) → c` and `h2 : p(b) → d`, so I want to include these in my wlog.

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 14 2018 at 12:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132101891):
What's the goal?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 14 2018 at 12:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132101933):
what do you mean by pseudo order relation? `wlog` is very general, so I'm sure it will apply, but you have to figure out how to get it in a form it can accept

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 12:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132102577):
I want to wlog over `a b c d` where I have `p a b c d \or p c d a b`, I just tried `wlog h : p a b c d` and it asked me for a proof of `p a b c d \or p c d a b`, which was very surprising. Sometimes Lean is a lot smarter than I expect.

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 12:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132103235):
So I started the wlog proof, and I finished the first case. Now for the second case it wants a proof of `h1 : p(b) → c` and `h1 : p(a) → d`, but those aren't true. How would I tell Lean to add `c` and `d` to the wlog, so they swap as well for the second case?

Ali -- can you formalise a MWE of what you're asking? i.e. abstract the situation and post a problem of the form `example (alpha : type) (p : alpha -> alpha -> alpha -> alpha -> Prop) (h1 : blah -> blah) (h2 : blah) ... : goal := sorry` and set it as a WLOG challenge.

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 13:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132104185):
I was fearing this, I'll see what I can do.

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 14:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132106746):
Here's a MWE: 
```lean
import tactic.wlog
variables {α : Type}

def E : α → α → α → α → Prop := sorry

def B : α → α → α → Prop := sorry

def D : α → α → α → α → Prop := sorry

def S : α → α → α → Prop := sorry

lemma S.symm {a b c : α} : S a b c → S a c b := sorry

lemma B.symm {a b c : α} : B a b c → B a c b := sorry

lemma E.flip {a b c d : α} : E a b c d → E b a d c := sorry

theorem t1 (a b c d : α) : D a b c d ∨ D c d a b := sorry

theorem t2 {a b c d p q r s : α} : D a b c d → E a b p q → E c d r s → D p q r s := sorry

theorem t3 {a b c : α} : S a b c → D a b a c → B a b c := sorry

theorem t4 {a b c p q r : α} : B a b c → B p q r → E a b p q → E a c p r → E b c q r := sorry

-- Had to name it a₁ because Lean didn't let me use a on line 39?
example {a₁ b c p q r : α} : S a₁ b c → S p q r → E a₁ b p q → E a₁ c p r → E b c q r := 
begin
intros h h1 h2 h3,
wlog h4 : D a₁ b a₁ c,
    exact t1 a₁ b a₁ c,
  have h5 : D p q p r,
    exact t2 h4 h2 h3,
  have h6 : B a₁ b c,

  exact t4 h6 h7 h2 h3,
have hx : ∀ p q r, S a₁ c b → S p q r → E a₁ c p q → E a₁ b p r → E c b q r := sorry,
-- This is what I would expect the WLOG to give me to use as "this",
exact (hx p r q h.symm h1.symm h3 h2).flip
end

--A way around this is to change the statement, but that isn't ideal

example {a₁ b c : α} : S a₁ b c → ∀ p q r, S p q r → E a₁ b p q → E a₁ c p r → E b c q r := 
begin
intros h,

    exact t3 h1 h5,
  exact t4 h6 h7 h2 h3,
exact (this h.symm p r q a.symm a_2 a_1).flip
end
```

I'd also like to know how to name everything WLOG gives me, and why I had to use `a₁` instead of `a`.

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 14 2018 at 14:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/WLOG/near/132108487):
You should never try to name anything `a` in Lean. That's a name Lean uses, and trying to also use it can only lead to cryptic error messages

```lean

The `a` thing is a bug in the parser, which won't be fixed until Lean 4.

Ok thanks, I was hoping wlog could revert for me,
