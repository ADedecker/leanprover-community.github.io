I might have a crack at showing that sets form a category that is a model of ETCS https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ETCS

Or at least build a model of ETCS in Lean. Not sure quite what the sets of Lean *are* yet.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) David Michael Roberts (Oct 10 2018 at 07:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/ETCS/near/135520216):
I mean, I notice that in `set_theory.zfc` presets are used, but I can't tell if these are the same as Bishop-style presets (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/preset) and then sets are what are sometimes called setoids (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/equivalence+relation#setoids)

There are multiple formalizations of sets in Lean, depending on your needs. `set_theory.zfc` is if you're interested in (untyped) ZFC set theory, `data.set` formalize sets whose elements have a certain type as predicates on that type and `data.finset` formalizes finite sets whose elements also have a given type.

In `set_theory.zfc` there is `pSet` but there's also `Set` which might be more useful

I think that `pSet` is indeed a preset in the nLab sense

Yes, I could show that ZFC-sets give a model of ETCS, but it would be more interesting to show that one could build the category of "sets" directly, without knowing a well-founded \in-tree structure on them.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 10 2018 at 07:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/ETCS/near/135520466):
although of course there is an equality relation on `pSet`, since it is a type; this equality is too fine for ZFC and `Set` is a quotient of this by set extensionality

So I guess: is there a way to talk about sets native to Lean, as there is in HoTT, for instance? (where there is the type of hSets)

hSet = Type in lean

all types are "sets" in the HoTT sense, because of proof irrelevance

So, in principle, one could try to show that Type is (the objects of) a category—perhaps this is done already—and then show it is a term of type `ETCS`, once that is defined.

@**David Michael Roberts** Nice seeing you here!

`Type` is indeed a model of ETCS; function extensionality should correspond to well-pointedness,  working in `classical`, we have choice, `Prop` is the subobject classifier, and  the NNO is `nat`.

Sure, but is it _proved_ to be a model of ETCS? And, if I use the constructive fragment, do I get a model of the constructive version (a la I guess Mike Shulman's "material and structural set theories" paper)

Also, one could go the whole hog and show without using even `Prop` that Type is some kind of predicative topos...

There is a constructive version of well-pointedness, that doesn't force Booleanness. just that "a global element of the subobject classifier is false if and only if it is not true." (from https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/well-pointed+topos)

And as far as predicative stuff, one could show directly that Type is a Pi-W-pretopos satisfying some version of WISC (??? not sure about that one), following eg Benno van den Berg

I'm not sure about WISC, seems like any version of the axiom of choice is likely to be false without `choice`, but I checked the proof that epis are surjective in lean:
```lean
universe u
theorem epi {α β : Type u} (f : α → β)
  (H : ∀ (γ : Type u) (g h : β → γ), g ∘ f = h ∘ f → g = h) (y : β) : ∃ x, f x = y :=
let g (y : β) : ulift.{u} Prop := ⟨∃ x, f x = y⟩,
    h (y : β) : ulift.{u} Prop := ⟨true⟩ in
have g = h, from H _ g h (funext $ λ x,
  congr_arg ulift.up $ eq_true_intro $ by exact ⟨_, rfl⟩),
by injection congr_fun this y; exact cast eq_true h_1
```
and it looks like you need `Prop` and `propext` essentially (you can't prove it using `trunc`, and you certainly can't prove it "constructively" i.e. with a sigma)

Actually I find this to be an interesting example of a "nonconstructive" constructive exists, in the sense that you can't upgrade the exists to a data type even though the proof does not use choice.

I am almost certain that WISC is not provable, although I don't think there is an easy proof of this. I don't think Asaf Karagila's proof https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4396.pdf is much affected by the presence of inaccessible cardinals, so it should be independent of lean as well by simulation in ZFC + omega inaccessibles (below the first inaccessible because we are working in `Type`).

Well, I did prove (on paper) that WISC isn't provable from the axioms of an elementary topos, by constructing a topos where it fails :-)

I suppose that's also an option... I guess lean has a bit more structure though, so maybe you have to do that with pi-W-toposes? Is that a thing?

@**David Michael Roberts** I'm not sure if

> a global element of the subobject classifier is false if and only if it is not true

holds without invoking `classical`. Without being able to take a filterquotient of `Prop`, it's just a massive Heyting algebra, and even with excluded middle, if Lean knows that $$ \vdash p \vee \neg p$$, it does not necessarily decide if $$p$$ is true or false.

Lean is also not quite a topos over $$\mathbf{Set}$$, for it lacks externally indexed colimits (while $$\Sigma$$-types and quotient types give all internally indexed colimits).

@**Jesse Michael Han** Could you unpack what that statement about the subobject classifier should mean? I assume `Prop` is a subobject classifier for `Type` even without `choice` (but assuming `propext`), because every monomorphism in `Type` is an injection, and so it factors through the subtype on the range.

Actually, I see another problem: If f : A -> X is a monomorphism and g : X -> Prop is the function `g x = \ex a, f x = a`, then we want a pullback square with the `true : unit -> Prop` function. But the subtype is a pullback, and A is not constructively isomorphic to the subtype, so I don't think it holds. That is, `Prop` isn't even a subobject classifier.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Jesse Michael Han (Oct 14 2018 at 02:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/ETCS/near/135754838):
That's interesting. (I assume you mean `g x = \ex a, f a = x`.) Why is the image of an injection not constructively isomorphic to its domain?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 03:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/ETCS/near/135755636):
There are a few ways to look at it. My favorite is to think in terms of what is "data" vs "erased" stuff, which corresponds to stuff that the computer could actually execute or manipulate. If you have a function f : A -> X where A and X are both data types, then f is a real *function*, something that transforms one kind of representation into another. There is no guarantee that this transformation is invertible, and in particular assuming that f is injective does not supply you with such an inverse. (This is why `equiv` contains an explicit inverse function, and `bijection` is a weaker notion.) So defining a function from A to {x // x \in range f} is easy by restricting the codomain of f, but you don't have enough data for the converse function.

In set theory you would use the exists assumption to give the value, but since this is a Prop, it is "not data" and can't be turned into data. If you use a Type-valued equivalent, like `trunc {a // f a = x}`, then it would be constructively bijective, but in this case I'm not sure it's a pullback.

If that's the case, when maybe one does need 'classical' to show that `Prop` (which is then `bool`) is a subobject classifier after all.

Could you explain why couldn't we do something like, take the collection of pairs $$(a, f(a))$$ and flip the pairs to get an inverse?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 03:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/ETCS/near/135755947):
Ah, here's another way to show choiceless `Type` is not a topos:
> Corollary 4.2. $$\mathbf{C}$$ is balanced, i.e., a morphism in $$\mathbf{C}$$ is an isomorphism iff it is both monic and epic. (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/subobject+classifier)

This is not true in `Type`, since as I said monic means `injective` and epic means `surjective`, and the conjunction of these is `bijective` which is not the same as `equiv` which is isomorphism.

Actually unique choice is enough to prove that a bijection is an equiv

> Could you explain why couldn't we do something like, take the collection of pairs $$(a, f(a))$$ and flip the pairs to get an inverse?

because that's not how functions are defined in type theory. In type theory every function is given by a term that has a free variable for the argument

a definition like that one would give a functional relation, but proving that a functional relation induces a function requires unique choice

By the way, this kind of thing comes up even in "real math". For example, the derivative of a function is a functional relation, not a function

You can of course use choice to upgrade it to a function but it's not quite natural and lean will make it feel a little awkward

Right, I see.

Ah, here's another way to show choiceless `Type` is not a topos:
> Corollary 4.2. $$\mathbf{C}$$ is balanced, i.e., a morphism in $$\mathbf{C}$$ is an isomorphism iff it is both monic and epic. (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/subobject+classifier)

This is not true in `Type`, since as I said monic means `injective` and epic means `surjective`, and the conjunction of these is `bijective` which is not the same as `equiv` which is isomorphism.
```

This is what one usually uses to show that the image of a mono is isomorphic to its domain, so that makes sense.

Well, that was the informal explanation. The real definition is Def 4.1 in Shulman's https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05204.pdf and is stated in the context of a Heyting category, so no subobject classifier necessary.

Also, I wouldn't naively take Prop to be the subobject classifier. What about `1 ->  Prop`?

Looking at

Def 4.1 in Shulman's https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05204.pdf

part a) gives me pause. The other parts b)-d) seem ok (Epis are surjective, "every function 1-> U \cup V factors through U or V" and `1->0` is empty).

I guess (b) isn't obvious to me, mostly because I'm learning the terminology as I go

But (a) does indeed look to be false. If `m : A -> X` is `bijective`, then for every `x : X` (add `1 -> ` if you like) there exists `y : A` such that `f x = y`, but it is not necessarily an isomorphism

By Remark 4.2 b) is equiv to epis are surjective, which you proved above.

But, I think we have to be more careful about what the actual category under discussion is. Is all the metatheory being internalized to Lean?

I just tuned in and I'm not really sure what is going on here, but in the opposite direction it seems that (c) could fail if you interpreted "either A or B must be ..." in a strong external sense, as well

ah, that would be quantifying over `1->X` I suppose, leading to a section (?). This is the old problem that with the strong constructive quantifier the axiom of choice is simply true.

If A = B then `1 = A \cup A`, and then by pushing the unique element of 1 around you find A = 1 and hence 1 has two distinct elements, which is false

If `1 = A \cup B` then you get a distinguished element of `A \cup B`, and by following it you find which one is isomorphic to 1

Re: the preceding discussion, I think one again needs unique choice to show (besides ruling out things like uninvertible bijections) that any epimorphism satisfies the universal property with respect to its kernel relation on its domain (i.e. is regular).
