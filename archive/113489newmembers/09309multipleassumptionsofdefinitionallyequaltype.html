<p>I have come across a situation where, in tactic mode, I have two assumptions in my context whose types are not equal but they are definitionally equal. Specifically, for a particular expression <code>_e</code>, the types are <code>m ∈ _e</code> and <code>_e = some m</code>. I would like to rewrite using the equality. However, when I use <code>rw ‹_e = some m›</code> the <code>rw</code> tactic fails because the assumption of type <code>m ∈ _e</code> appears before the other one in the context, and so the tactic <code>‹_e = some m›</code> returns the wrong assumption.</p>
<p>Of course, I can use the names of the assumptions instead of the <code>‹⬝›</code> tactic, but I would like to avoid using names if I can.</p>
<p>Is this a known problem? is it considered a "problem"?</p>
