<p>how to show a type info of a region? If I have a cursor on a symbol it shows me in the mini-buffer the type, but if I select an expression I don't have the type in the mini-buffer.</p>

<p>There's a hole command for doing this -- put <code>{! !}</code> around the expression. Then there's a key command to trigger the hole command but I forget what it is in emacs.</p>

<p><code>C-c SPC</code></p>

<p>hum, it didn't find one valid identifier. Assuming that once the mini-buffer is called I have to use the <code>Infer</code></p>

<p>It should say "Infer type of the expression in the hole", maybe it's not displaying properly. Hole commands are slightly buggy sometimes. Do you have a small example I could try?</p>

<p>I'm on VS Code, so we can at least see if it's an editor issue.</p>

<p>I will try with VS. Maybe I can isolate a fragment to show here. I will try</p>
