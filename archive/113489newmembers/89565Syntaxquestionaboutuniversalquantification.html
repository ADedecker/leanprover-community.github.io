<p>Hi, I am going through chapter 4 in the documentation.  I have a question about ∀.  Is there  a nice syntactic way to put a condition on a forall?  For example I am going through the exercises where you define prime numbers.  What I came up with was this :<br>
 def prime (n : ℕ) : Prop :=(n &gt; 1) ∧ (∀ k : ℕ,  (k = 1) ∨ ¬(divides n k)). <br>
It seems like the ∨ part at the end is somewhat burdensome for describing a constraint.   Some of the later exercises such as the Goldbach weak Conjecture were even hairier when using ∨  as a constraint mechanism.</p>
