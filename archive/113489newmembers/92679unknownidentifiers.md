The int.mod, int.div, and int.fdiv in this example code https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/251a8c367bec656a85a70894b169a1e555efd2bd/docs/theories/integers.md  are returning the errors: `unknown identifier 'int.mod'` for each function in vscode. Have the identifiers changed at all recently?

Ah yeah, it just doesn't work on the homebrew install on my mac. It works on the install I have on Ubuntu. Thanks.
