<p>Has anyone here made a spacemacs layer for lean that they would be willing to share?  I'm a long time vim user who has just started reading about spacemacs &amp; emacs last week in order to use lean.  I found <a href="https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean">https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean</a>, but I couldn't get it to work.  I'm probably just making silly errors since I'm still unfamiliar with spacemacs.  I'll keep reading the documentation until I figure it out, but if anyone can speed me along that would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I see the last commit is from one year ago. Lean has changed a lot in the last year. That might be the problem. Maybe you should contact the author to see if he intends to update it.</p>

<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> uses spacemacs.  You might want to look at his <a href="https://github.com/Kha/dotfiles/blob/1ba199125c707859a3f2376603b23fca1f6d176d/.spacemacs#L330-L335" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/Kha/dotfiles/blob/1ba199125c707859a3f2376603b23fca1f6d176d/.spacemacs#L330-L335">configuration</a> for inspiration.  Most of lean-mode works out of the box.</p>

<p>great, thank you!</p>

<p>I didn't have much luck with that layer either but I ended up taking the keyboard shortcuts it provides</p>
