<p>I have two questions about coercions :</p>
<p>1) Is there a direct way to go from <code>0:nat &lt; 2:nat</code> to <code>0:real &lt; 2:real</code> ?</p>
<p>2) I have a type X,  E is of type <code>set X</code>, and <code>x : \N \to E</code>,  is there a way to see x as a sequence in X rather than in E? <code>\u x</code>does not seem to work.<br>
The context is that I have a defintion of limit in X and I would like to apply it to sequences in E. Of course I can declare <code>x: \N \to X</code> and add the property that every value of x is in E, but I guess coercions are designed to do the job.</p>
