<p>I notice <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> put up a nice short video on getting required dependencies, VS Code and Lean installed on Mac, here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8U6YOK7c0M" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8U6YOK7c0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8U6YOK7c0M</a></p>

<p>I also rewrote my cheap Windows installation page: <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/a-cheap-hack-to-get-lean-and-mathlib-running-on-a-windows-10-machine/" target="_blank" title="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/a-cheap-hack-to-get-lean-and-mathlib-running-on-a-windows-10-machine/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/a-cheap-hack-to-get-lean-and-mathlib-running-on-a-windows-10-machine/</a> . I intend over the next day or two to make a link at the top of my blog pointing to various installation pages / posts, which are now randomly scattered online.</p>

<p>I'm still going to make the corresponding video for installation on Windows!</p>

<p>Be sure to ping me when you do. I am expecting this question to come up a fair bit at Imperial over the next few weeks</p>

<p>Okay, the video for installing on Windows 10 is now up! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f_9Zetekd8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f_9Zetekd8&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f_9Zetekd8&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Would it be possible for you to write a page for mathlib that links to the various tutorials and videos for installing lean and/or mathlib?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Oct 09 2018 at 08:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135446958):
<p>I will try to find the time today. On this thread we have Scott's two videos, there are my cheap and less cheap blog posts, there is some elan link somewhere... Is that it?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Oct 09 2018 at 08:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135446966):
<p>There's the official instructions of course!</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 09 2018 at 08:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135447815):
<p>It would also be good to have follow on instructions for people who followed Scott's instructions and want mathlib</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 09 2018 at 08:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135448769):
<p>Yes, I was thinking that's a separate video, that applies equally on Windows and macos, because it happens entirely within VS Code.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 09 2018 at 08:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135448783):
<p>(That's part of the reason for setting up a usable terminal on Windows, so afterwards everything can be done from VS Code.)</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 09 2018 at 08:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135448790):
<p>(Although it occurs to me the Windows video should have included that one extra step, to hook up git bash as the default terminal instead of powershell.)</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 09 2018 at 10:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135451532):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130308">@Neil Strickland</span> This thread contains two videos with installation instructions. Kevin is also updating his instructions. Would you mind adding links to these videos etc on your MO post? I think you pointed out a very good issue (that installation was horribly difficult). I also hope that we are addressing them now. What do you think?</p>

#### [ David Michael Roberts (Oct 09 2018 at 12:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135459174):
<p>Maybe the windows video should go in its own topic, for ease of finding?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 09 2018 at 13:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135460140):
<p>Hopefully there will be permanent links to these soon from more prominent places...</p>

<p>I am just going to have an "installing lean" link at the top of my blog with multiple options</p>

#### [ David Michael Roberts (Oct 10 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518661):
<p>OK, so I have actually installed Lean and VS code as per <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> 's video, and now want to do some mathlibbing. But I am told by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> 's post <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/how-to-install-mathlib-and-keep-it-up-to-date/" target="_blank" title="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/how-to-install-mathlib-and-keep-it-up-to-date/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/how-to-install-mathlib-and-keep-it-up-to-date/</a> that I probably am better off with the nightly build of lean, so that mathlib will have the latest and greatest stuff.  After following the instructions at that post:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>leanpkg new my_project
cd my_project
leanpkg add https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib
leanpkg build
</pre></div>


<p>I get</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>davidroberts$ leanpkg build
configuring my_project 0.1
mathlib: trying to update _target/deps/mathlib to revision 905345a2ceaa5d0c7bc2f6310026961416b2cae4
&gt; git checkout --detach 905345a2ceaa5d0c7bc2f6310026961416b2cae4    # in directory _target/deps/mathlib
HEAD is now at 905345a fix(data/array/lemmas,...): fix build
&gt; lean --make src
</pre></div>


<p>and this was much much quicker than I thought it would be. Is it working or no?</p>

<p>It could well be.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518672):
<p>leanpkg build, and lean --make src don't compile all of mathlib</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518674):
<p>They only compile those parts of it which are imported by some file in <code>src/</code>.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518675):
<p>This might mean nothing at all at the moment.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518716):
<p>Add a file under <code>src/</code> that imports, e.g. <code>data.nat.prime</code>.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518742):
<p><em>However</em>, what you did _still_ doesn't get you the latest and greatest version of mathlib.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518743):
<p>:-(</p>

<p>If you look up that git commit hash you'll see it's from June 21.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518791):
<p>This is because <code>leanpkg</code> is taking you to the latest commit on the <code>lean-3.4.1</code> branch, which for some reason (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> ?) never gets updated?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518799):

<p>To get the actual latest version, you should edit your <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 10 2018 at 06:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518808):
<p>I guess it points to something like the earliest commit compatible with 3.4.1?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518868):
<p>And replace the line <code>lean_version = ...</code> with <code>lean_version = "nightly-2018-08-23"</code>.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 10 2018 at 06:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518879):
<p>(I better make another video. :-)</p>

<p>Aha, doing <code>leanpkg build</code> after adding a file to <code>src/</code>containing <code>import data.nat.prime</code> (plus an <code>#eval 2+2</code>) makes it do a lot more</p>

#### [ David Michael Roberts (Oct 10 2018 at 06:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Mac%20installation/near/135518898):

<p>ah, ok! I'll do that once the current build has finished</p>

<p>I wonder if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> cares about where <code>lean-3.4.1</code> points, anymore.</p>

<p>The "you're better off with the nightly build" comment was from when Lean 3.4 was changing a lot, and mathlib would change to keep up with Lean. This is all much less of an issue nowadays.</p>

<p>I wanted it to stay still between June and September. Thank you <em>very</em> much Mario for making it stay still over my summer project. I now really really don't want it to stay still any more for the simple reason that it is causing constant confusion amongst users.</p>

<p>No, it ties in to the way leanpkg works</p>
