<p>and I wish to prove something about <code>α</code>, where I will induct on the minimum <code>length</code> of an element of <code>foo a</code>.</p>
<p>In maths parlance, I would say "Suppose <code>b</code> is an element of <code>foo a</code> of minimal length.  We will induct on this minimal length..." and then I can induct.  How do I set this up in lean.  Are there any docs that I can read about this that aren't just uncommented code?</p>
<p>As an aside rant, am I doing something wrong in that I'm finding lean a really difficult language/framework to pick up?  Simply finding the lemmas I need (or working out that they don't exist) is a huge pain, and <code>#find</code> in the mathlib doesn't seem to ever work for me.  I feel as if I need to memorize what is where in the mathlib, and it is becoming quite a chore.  I also find myself wishing for much more "the beginner's guide to proving stuff in mathlib about {lattices | rings | finite things | lists }"-like documentation.  Ok.  <code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code>  Any advice would be useful.</p>
