<p>Hello!  I am new to this but I have been working through tutorials and the libraries, and I am ready to start a project.<br>
I would like to do something in mathematical physics.  My original hope was to start defining perturbative quantum field<br>
theory along the lines of Kevin Costello's book.  Or I might try something simpler, like classical mechanics of particles.<br>
My question is, are there any near-term plans to put any functional analysis into mathlib.  Even functions from R to R^k and<br>
basic calculus would be enough to do something.  I saw the topology definitions, Cauchy sequences and data.complex.exponential.<br>
Are these the foundations that will be used, or is this up for discussion?  Has anyone outlined what this would look like ?  Thanks!</p>

<p>I just found analysis.normed_space.deriv, will look at that now.  But clearly there is a long way to go.  Is there a plan?</p>
