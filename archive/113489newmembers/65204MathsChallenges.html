<p>As if I didn't have too much to do already, I'm going to start running <a href="https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/challenges.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/challenges.md">Maths challenges for the Lean curious</a> and I'll promote it on Twitter. My understanding of Lean on Twitter is that Lean is quite a niche thing (apparently -- I must be in some kind of bubble?), but there are sufficiently many people on Twitter who are sufficiently Lean-curious that they will try the natural number game and then perhaps ask what to do next. All my answers so far have been lacking in some ways (e.g. "wait until I finish the real number game"/"wait until I finish some more levels of the natural number game"/"wait until I write the integer game"/"read Theorem Proving In Lean"/"try doing some maths on your own and get completely stuck and then ask on the chat"). On the other hand I am hoping that I will be able to knock off one relatively simple question per week (maybe I will even do a few this week, to get the ball rolling) to give beginners some experience. </p>
<p>I will note that I wouldn't really be able to do this without the wonderful <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor">community Lean web editor</a> so many thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> and whoever else was involved with making this tool. The official Lean web editor is simply too old now, it adds to the confusion rather than making life easier. I teach the <code>use</code> tactic in natnumgame and it's not in the official editor.</p>
