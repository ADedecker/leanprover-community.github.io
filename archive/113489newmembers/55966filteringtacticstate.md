<p>once in a blue moon I managed to accidentally discover a “filter” drop down menu in the tactic state which allowed me to remove the _ variables or just show the goal, and I have no idea how to see this drop down menu again</p>

<p>is this a secret feature?</p>

<p>The dropdown will only appear if (1) you're in "Display Goal" mode (2) your cursor is inside a tactic mode block so that there's something to filter (3) you haven't replaced the array of filters in your extension settings with an empty array.</p>
