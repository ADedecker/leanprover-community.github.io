<p>yes, you need to reply to threads explicitly, but small questions need not have their own topic, it seems</p>

<p>Yeah, it's confusing to see different streams interleaved on one page.</p>

<p>Ah, so <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> is a “stream,” and it has multiple “topics.” Now the terminology is coming together in my head.</p>

<p>If yes then you can preface the file with <code>import tactic.ring</code>, and right after <code>unfold_zero</code>, write <code>ring, tauto</code> and be done</p>

<p>Because the terms' structure as a tree of constructors is the same. See "structural induction", which is induction over that tree.</p>

<p>What type of equality do terms need to be for <code>rw</code> to work? I think that's slightly weaker than structural equality since it unfold reducibles</p>

<p>This is Chapter 3 exercise from the book. My hypothesis <code>h</code> is a lambda, and the only way I know how to make progress with it is by applying it to something, but I have nothing else to go by</p>

<p>Patrick has a point though. I found it much easier to learn tactic mode first. Without it, the goal is an <code>and</code> statement and you can construct proofs of such statements with <code>and.intro</code> as Simon says. In general I guess this is the way to think about it. For each of these things (and, or, implies etc) you need to learn how to construct it (i.e. make it) and how to eliminate it (i.e. use it). <code>and.intro</code> is a constructor for <code>and</code>.</p>

<p>When I hover over <code>rintro</code> in VS code I seem to get an error in the popup about interactive.param_desc.
