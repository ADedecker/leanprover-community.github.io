yes, you need to reply to threads explicitly, but small questions need not have their own topic, it seems

previously people were doing @person | quote "..." and then their reply

this is definitely better for a larger chat room. which hopefully will happen since Lean is going to be super popular

I was going to ask that! It will be weird referring to people by name instead of handle

Interesting. I was apparently using the "all messages" tab which somehow forwarded to New Members automatically.

Oh, I think I see. It's a different channel?

everything on zulip is filtered by topic and stream

Yeah, it's confusing to see different streams interleaved on one page.

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 20:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/123008810):
If you click on a topic, you'll only see the messages that belong to that topic

probably want to deselect "all messages" at the top left of your screen then

zulip is what i think happened when a bulletin board and irc server had a lovechild

It's the #**new members** view that I'm on. I don't yet know what topics I'm interested in, so I'm not sure which ones to look at.

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 26 2018 at 20:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/123008946):
I don't see a way to merge topics. That would probably help.

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Feb 26 2018 at 20:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/123008955):
if topics share something in common they should probably be filtered at the stream level

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 26 2018 at 20:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/123008970):
Ah, so #**new members** is a “stream,” and it has multiple “topics.” Now the terminology is coming together in my head.

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 26 2018 at 20:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/123009044):
And I'm too tired to fully comprehend anything else about Zulip right now. I'm sure I'll find lots of messages in the morning. Good night!

You can still use the opportunity to brighten your previous profile picture before uploading

Can someone help me with the Jacobian Identity, there are so many brackets, how can I easily  expand all the brackets ?

And how can I use a+b+c = (a+b)+c, the add_assoc can only prove a+b+c=a+(b+c)

```
structure vector (R : Type) :=
vec :: (x : R) (y : R) (z : R)


namespace vector

variables {R : Type} [comm_ring R]

def zero : vector R := vec 0 0 0

def add (a b : vector R) := 
vec (a.x + b.x) (a.y + b.y) (a.z + b.z)

def cross_prod (a b : vector R) := 
vec (a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y) (a.x * b.z - a.z * b.x) (a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x)

theorem jacobian : ∀ (a b c: vector R) , 
 add (cross_prod a (cross_prod b c)) (add (cross_prod b (cross_prod c a))  (cross_prod c (cross_prod a b))) = zero :=
begin
  intro a,
  intro b,
  intro c,
  unfold add,
  unfold cross_prod,
  unfold zero,
  dsimp,
  congr,
  simp,
  rw mul_add,
  rw add_comm,
  rw mul_add,
  rw add_comm,
  rw add_assoc,

end
end vector
```

If yes then you can preface the file with `import tactic.ring`, and right after `unfold_zero`, write `ring, tauto` and be done

#### [ JIANXIONG SUN (Aug 17 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/132328071):
It's a good method, but actually I want to show the steps of the proof :-)

`a + b + c` is definitionally equal to `(a + b) + c`, the pretty printer doesn't display the brackets since they are unnecessary.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Aug 17 2018 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/132328249):
it's more than definitional equality (!) it's parsing

why "structure"?

Because the terms' structure as a tree of constructors is the same. See "structural induction", which is induction over that tree.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Aug 18 2018 at 00:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/132329537):
What type of equality do terms need to be for `rw` to work? I think that's slightly weaker than structural equality since it unfold reducibles

the non crazy overpowered solution is just to use `<-`:

`simp` will also do AC rewriting, so `by simp [mul_comm, mul_assoc]` also works without mathlib

This is Chapter 3 exercise from the book. My hypothesis `h` is a lambda, and the only way I know how to make progress with it is by applying it to something, but I have nothing else to go by

I am trying to make it through without tactics, as I'm still trying to wrap my head around propositions as types, and tactics have yet to be introduced at this point

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Aug 27 2018 at 21:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/%28no%20topic%29/near/132875385):
Patrick has a point though. I found it much easier to learn tactic mode first. Without it, the goal is an `and` statement and you can construct proofs of such statements with `and.intro` as Simon says. In general I guess this is the way to think about it. For each of these things (and, or, implies etc) you need to learn how to construct it (i.e. make it) and how to eliminate it (i.e. use it). `and.intro` is a constructor for `and`.

I'll tell you how a mathematician would do it. First install mathlib (of course). Then
```lean
import tactic.interactive

variables (p q r : Prop) [decidable p] [decidable q] 
example : ((p ∨ q) → r) ↔ (p → r) ∧ (q → r) := 
by tauto
```

I'm currently reading the book "How to Proove It" alongside trying to learn Lean, so I'm far from a mathematician who needs to use it for anything serious. It's more of an exercise in mind expansion for me

Well here's a tactic mode proof:

```lean
example (p q r : Prop) : ((p ∨ q) → r) ↔ (p → r) ∧ (q → r) := 
begin
  split,
  { intro H,
    split,
    { intro Hp,
      apply H,
      left,
      exact Hp

    { intro Hq,
      apply H,
      right,
      exact Hq
    }
  },
  intro H,
  cases H with Hpr Hqr,
  intro Hpq,
  cases Hpq with Hp Hq,
  { apply Hpr,
    exact Hp
  },
  { apply Hqr,
    exact Hq
  }
end

```

It's cool to step through it looking at the goals etc at each step.

If you don't like decidability assumptions but still like automation, what about:
```lean
example (p q r : Prop) : ((p ∨ q) → r) ↔ (p → r) ∧ (q → r) :=

When I hover over `rintro` in VS code I seem to get an error in the popup about interactive.param_desc. I don't really get it but maybe there's some missing description like in Kevin's post here https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/lean.20golf/near/132604473 . I'm guessing this is low priority and I shouldn't worry about this anyways.

Reading the `rintro` docstring made me want to play around with `rintro?`. However, appending a question mark to `rcases` in the above proof just resulted in an "unexpected token" error. Is there a better example I can try?

I got it now, but had to look up almost the full solution before getting it. very tricky indeed.

My plan is to solve all the exercises first using term level solutions that read as naturally as possible, then go and write a second pass removing all the syntax sugar, and then move on to the tactics chapter and re-write them all using those again

Chris the original statement can be expressed in Presburger arithmetic (natural numbers with only addition), which has a decidable theory -- that's what Seul Baek implemented in `cooper`, I believe.

@**Tobias Grosser** Is also working on Presburger arithmetic in Lean. He told me he would like to match up with someone who knows Lean/maths to get implement a version for mathlib.

An additional question-- something that I have no idea how to fix. I currently have 

```
an9 : 1 + x ^ 2 ≡ 0 [MOD p]
⊢ 1 + x ^ 2 ≡ 0 [MOD p]
``` 
and ``` exact an9, ``` gives the error message:

```
invalid type ascription, term has type
  nat.modeq p (@has_add.add nat nat.has_add 1 (@has_pow.pow nat nat (@monoid.has_pow nat nat.monoid) x 2)) 0
but is expected to have type
  nat.modeq p (@has_add.add nat nat.has_add 1 (@has_pow.pow nat nat nat.has_pow x 2)) 0
```
In the middle of a complicated code, so I haven't made an MWE yet. Would this be easily fixable? (Before I try a different approach)

Does `simpa` or `simpa using an9` work? I think there's a simp lemma for rewriting pow on `nat`.

```simpa using an9,``` works! Thanks!

@**Johan Commelin** , yes I am interested in Presburger arithmetic.Still learning more about lean, but I am certainly interested to chat about this. In case sb is interested in collaborating, I am open to collaborative visits or internships @ETH.

How can I represent square or cube in Lean such as x^2?

what error does lean give you when you write `x^2`?
