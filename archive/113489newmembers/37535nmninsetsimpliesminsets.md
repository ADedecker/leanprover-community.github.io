<p>How do you prove this in tactic mode? Or if you know how to get to term mode while in tactic mode in the middle of the proof, a term proof would also work.</p>

<p>Oh yes, thank you.</p>

<p>It's easier in tactic mode than term mode :-) In term mode you have to use the dreaded triangle \t, which I have very limited success with.</p>

<p>that triangle should have an "!" in the middle of it.</p>
