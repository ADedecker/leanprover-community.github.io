<p>How do I solve the following goal : </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>ε : ℝ,
H : ε &gt; 0,
n : ℕ,
H_1 : nat_ceil (1 / ε) &lt; n
⊢ abs (↑n)⁻¹ &lt; ε
</pre></div>


<p>What sort of tactics would be useful here?</p>

<p>This is a nice question. The result is trivial mathematically, but I suspect it's still a bit of work in Lean. We have tactics which help with this sort of thing. My first instinct is to turn H_1 into an inequality about reals (there should be a tactic which does this now but I'm not up to speed with how it's done nowadays, I just remember sweating 2 years ago). Then there will be theorems in the library saying 1/e&lt;=(nat_ceil (1/e) : real) and 0&lt;x&lt;y -&gt; 1/y&lt;1/x which I would be tempted to apply manually. Then you should be reduced to abs (\u n)\-1 = 1/n which should hopefully be less of a pain. I would love it if someone could use tactics to make this less painful.</p>
