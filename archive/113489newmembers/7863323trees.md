<p>Dear all, I am writing a tactic and I want to keep a set of things in a datastructure for quick access. In other languages you would use a 23tree or similar. Is there something like this in the Lean library? Otherwise I am fine just keeping a <code>list</code> of objects and removing the dupes but I thought I'd check if the datastructure is in there.</p>

<p>Yes there's the <code>rbmap</code> which should be available without imports</p>

<p>Yes, sure. You can also put it in <code>namespace list ... end list</code> so that, inside the namespace, you don't have to specify <code>list.</code> everywhere but outside, you can still use <code>my_list.myextension</code> to call it with argument <code>my_list</code></p>

<p>What is the difference between <code>import</code> and <code>open</code>?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 01:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131204294):
<p><code>import</code> is about modules i.e. source files and <code>open</code> is about namespaces which can span multiple files.</p>

#### [ Edward Ayers (Aug 10 2018 at 02:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131204379):
<p>if I <code>import</code> a source file, is that effectively the same as pasting it above my code?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 02:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131204442):
<p>You could say that. But it's a smart paste: it does not paste the same module more than once.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 03:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131209476):
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Is that a thing people want? It is conceivable that we could associate data to a typeclass on <code>set</code>, basically the same as <code>fintype s</code> currently but with a tree-like data structure. Currently you have to use explicit data structures like <code>rbmap</code> or <code>hash_map</code> or <code>finmap</code></p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 03:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131209657):
<p>What would the type class be applied to? The element type?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210024):
<p>the set</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210086):
<p>I'm not eager to go down that rabbit hole. In Haskell, a similar situation has created multiple types for strings and multiple solutions to simplify the situation once and for all with unclear consequences.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210092):
<p>in some ways it seems appealing, similar to decidability of a prop, you have representability of a set</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210122):
<p>but it's probably not good if the typeclass is not a subsingleton, meaning you have to hide a lot of structure</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210156):
<p>Yeah but with prop and decidability, the representation is unique.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210175):
<p>you can always perform a suitable quotient to make it a subsingleton</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210237):
<p>but you need more than decidable_eq if you want to have any representation better than an association list (which you already get with <code>fintype s</code>)</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210247):
<p>That creates another mess: if you take two sets as parameters, you have to anticipate that they have vastly different representations.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210266):
<p>what do you mean? If it is a binary tree structure the only representation ambiguity is wrt tree rotations</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210336):
<p>No I mean if you have a function that takes two sets as a parameter, one might be a binary search tree, the other may be represented as an assoc list (if I understand your quotient idea properly). That makes taking their union needlessly complicated.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210345):
<p>oh, no I wasn't thinking that</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210352):
<p>if you have two data structures which are both applicable here you have two typeclasses</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210365):
<p>I'm not even sure how to implement type ambiguity of that kind</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210419):
<p>Actually, I think existential types would be the best way to go. But I don't advise trying it at home.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210424):
<p>existential types don't really work in lean though</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210432):
<p>because of predicativity</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210452):
<p>Really? But if you have structure where one of the field is a type and the next is a type class assumption, doesn't that work?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210454):
<p>It's possible but it will live in a higher universe</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210462):
<p>Yeah, it is annoying to say the least</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210512):
<p>I guess it might work if it acts a bit like <code>monad</code> or <code>traversable</code>-type typeclasses</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210515):
<p>What kind of type classes do you have in mind? Do they including operations like union, intersection, empty set?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210520):
<p>At the very least</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210527):

<p>I found curious wrinkle about finset and traversable by the way but I think it's a different conversation.</p>

<p>that sounds ominous</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210580):
<p>I recall Johannes having difficulty defining the BNF instance for multiset because of quotients, I assume the issue is similar here</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210587):
<p>I think having that kind of type class would be useful but it should be a last resort of generalization. You should probably stick to concrete types of set representations in the type of your computable functions as much as possible.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210642):
<p>Does haskell have a typeclass for finite maps? Or is it just traversable</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210651):
<p>As for the wrinkle. I managed to make <code>multiset</code> sort-of traversable -- sort-of because in <code>traverse</code> (not its laws) I require the applicative to be lawful and commutative. In <code>finset</code>, I didn't manage to make it sort-of traversable because I would need <code>seq</code> to be idempotent. That's not a big wrinkle but our conversation reminded me of that.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210704):
<p>Officially, it's mostly just traversable and the like. Some packages have classes for that but they aren't very useable and don't simplify much.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210718):
<p>I think I just understood why you talked of monad and traversable. I think you're right. You might also need a lattice or a monoid</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210934):
<p>Why does <code>seq</code> have to be idempotent? Seems like the finset traverse should just refer to multiset traverse</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210959):
<p>Because somewhere in the laws, you need to prove the equivalence between pruning duplicates before and after a traversal with pruning them only after.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131211091):
<p>That's for a lawful traversable instance. The traverse implementation itself works for <code>finset</code></p>

<p>Lean has chosen to handle modules and namespaces orthogonally. A nice choice, I think. It means that if you need to prove something about lists, it doesn't need to go into the file <code>list.lean</code>, you can just prove <code>list.foobar</code> in your own file. Or you write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="n">list</span>

<span class="kn">lemma</span> <span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">....</span>

<span class="kn">end</span> <span class="n">list</span>

<p>Of course, that also means that you don't get access to <code>list.foobar</code> by just <code>import data.list</code>. You will also have to import the file where <code>list.foobar</code> is stated.</p>
<p><code>open list</code> means that inside the section/file where you issued the <code>open</code> command, you can just write <code>foobar</code> instead of <code>list.foobar</code>. If you already had a <code>foobar</code>, this would lead to ambiguity. You can close one of them with <code>close</code>. The root namespace is called <code>_root_</code>.</p>

<p>I really think that it is a pity that there is group theory in core, and stuff like this in mathlib... I wish it was the other way round (-;</p>
