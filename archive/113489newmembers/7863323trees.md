Dear all, I am writing a tactic and I want to keep a set of things in a datastructure for quick access. In other languages you would use a 23tree or similar. Is there something like this in the Lean library? Otherwise I am fine just keeping a `list` of objects and removing the dupes but I thought I'd check if the datastructure is in there.

Yes there's the `rbmap` which should be available without imports

perhaps I can just use `set` and lean will magically figure it out?

Yes, sure. You can also put it in `namespace list ... end list` so that, inside the namespace, you don't have to specify `list.` everywhere but outside, you can still use `my_list.myextension` to call it with argument `my_list`

What is the difference between `import` and `open`?

`import` is about modules i.e. source files and `open` is about namespaces which can span multiple files.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Edward Ayers (Aug 10 2018 at 02:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131204379):
if I `import` a source file, is that effectively the same as pasting it above my code?

You could say that. But it's a smart paste: it does not paste the same module more than once.

> perhaps I can just use `set` and lean will magically figure it out?

Is that a thing people want? It is conceivable that we could associate data to a typeclass on `set`, basically the same as `fintype s` currently but with a tree-like data structure. Currently you have to use explicit data structures like `rbmap` or `hash_map` or `finmap`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 03:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131209657):
What would the type class be applied to? The element type?

the set

I'm not eager to go down that rabbit hole. In Haskell, a similar situation has created multiple types for strings and multiple solutions to simplify the situation once and for all with unclear consequences.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210092):
in some ways it seems appealing, similar to decidability of a prop, you have representability of a set

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210122):
but it's probably not good if the typeclass is not a subsingleton, meaning you have to hide a lot of structure

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210156):
Yeah but with prop and decidability, the representation is unique.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210175):
you can always perform a suitable quotient to make it a subsingleton

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210237):
but you need more than decidable_eq if you want to have any representation better than an association list (which you already get with `fintype s`)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210247):
That creates another mess: if you take two sets as parameters, you have to anticipate that they have vastly different representations.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210266):
what do you mean? If it is a binary tree structure the only representation ambiguity is wrt tree rotations

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Aug 10 2018 at 04:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210336):
No I mean if you have a function that takes two sets as a parameter, one might be a binary search tree, the other may be represented as an assoc list (if I understand your quotient idea properly). That makes taking their union needlessly complicated.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 10 2018 at 04:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/23trees/near/131210345):
oh, no I wasn't thinking that

if you have two data structures which are both applicable here you have two typeclasses

I'm not even sure how to implement type ambiguity of that kind

Actually, I think existential types would be the best way to go. But I don't advise trying it at home.

existential types don't really work in lean though

Really? But if you have structure where one of the field is a type and the next is a type class assumption, doesn't that work?

I guess it might work if it acts a bit like `monad` or `traversable`-type typeclasses

I think having that kind of type class would be useful but it should be a last resort of generalization. You should probably stick to concrete types of set representations in the type of your computable functions as much as possible.

Does haskell have a typeclass for finite maps? Or is it just traversable

As for the wrinkle. I managed to make `multiset` sort-of traversable -- sort-of because in `traverse` (not its laws) I require the applicative to be lawful and commutative. In `finset`, I didn't manage to make it sort-of traversable because I would need `seq` to be idempotent. That's not a big wrinkle but our conversation reminded me of that.

Officially, it's mostly just traversable and the like. Some packages have classes for that but they aren't very useable and don't simplify much.

I think I just understood why you talked of monad and traversable. I think you're right. You might also need a lattice or a monoid

Why does `seq` have to be idempotent? Seems like the finset traverse should just refer to multiset traverse

Because somewhere in the laws, you need to prove the equivalence between pruning duplicates before and after a traversal with pruning them only after.

That's right but the laws it does mention do not connect `map` and `traverse`. In the case of `finset`, the trouble comes from proving `comp_traverse` anyway.

Lean has chosen to handle modules and namespaces orthogonally. A nice choice, I think. It means that if you need to prove something about lists, it doesn't need to go into the file `list.lean`, you can just prove `list.foobar` in your own file. Or you write
```lean
namespace list

lemma foobar : ....

end list
```
Of course, that also means that you don't get access to `list.foobar` by just `import data.list`. You will also have to import the file where `list.foobar` is stated.

`open list` means that inside the section/file where you issued the `open` command, you can just write `foobar` instead of `list.foobar`. If you already had a `foobar`, this would lead to ambiguity. You can close one of them with `close`. The root namespace is called `_root_`.

But if you use `mathlib`, you can import `meta.expr`and use `expr.list_local_const`

I really think that it is a pity that there is group theory in core, and stuff like this in mathlib... I wish it was the other way round (-;
