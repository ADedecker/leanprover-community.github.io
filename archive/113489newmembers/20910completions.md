<p>Hi gang where can I get a list of available completions for lean? Eg \all -&gt; forall symbol etc. vscode doesn't give me a list when I type <code>\</code>. Also what is the best way to ask questions that have likely come up before?</p>

<p>Also try out hovering over a Unicode character.  Vscode will then show a popup that explains how to typee it.</p>

<p>Still, I think this file should be more visible somehow</p>

<p>Maybe the popup could show a link to the translations file? If it is an actual hyperlink, then you don't even have to typeset the entire URL, so it wouldn't even take up much space.</p>
