<p>Hello, I have the hypothesis <code>k &lt; nat.succ n</code>, and I want to split the goal into two goals, one where the hypothesis is <code>k &lt; n</code> and another where the hypothesis is <code>k = n</code>. This is a bit like cases but going the wrong direction. Is there some way to do this?</p>
