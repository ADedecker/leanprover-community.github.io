<p>Hello everyone, I am Fabian Glöckle, masters student at University of Freiburg, Germany. I just got excited for formal theorem proving, know some (graduate level) number theory and sheaf theory and will be happy to learn and join in the movement! Currently, I am working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> on a small file about dual vector spaces.</p>

<p>Last time Johan mentioned dual vector spaces he seemed pretty depressed. Is it better now? It's a pretty important topic</p>

<p>Yes, we could prove that for finite dimensional vector spaces, a basis induces an isomorphism from the vector space to its dual. The proofs are a bit lengthy though and may need some refactoring before going to the library. I think we should also include the canonical injection into the bidual space into the file, this yet has to be done.</p>
