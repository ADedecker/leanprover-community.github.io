Hello, can I somehow upgrade my Lean version without reinstalling all of the stuff? I' running it on Win10 and have a Git Bash command line. I'm sorry if it is a bad thread for such question or anything, but I'm really new.

upgrade from what?

do you know the version or when you last used it?

Oh okay, I finally dealt with it. I just had many unsuccessful Lean installations and some different versions of Lean all over my disc which caused the confusion.  I guess it will work now.
