<p>Okay, so as was suggested to me the other day, I think it would be a good idea to prove Cayley's theorem in Lean. I think it would give me a good understanding of how certain mathematical structures are implemented in Lean, and would give me a chance to get some feedback on my code. Below is essentially my outline of a TODO.</p>
<p>Preliminaries: the first thing I need to do is talk about an arbitrary group G, with an operation <code>x</code>. Then I want the set of elements of G, S, defined. Third, I want to define the set F of bijective functions f: S -&gt; S, that is, the set of permutations of S. I assume it would be easiest to first construct this just at injective mappings, and then it should be easy to prove that they are also surjective. Then, I want a construction of function composition within F. The final thing I want to show in my preliminaries is that (F, *) is a group with respect to composition. I assume this might take some bit of doing, since I'll have to show there is an inverse map, and it is in F. This seems like the hardest bit out of the preliminaries, unless there is already something in function.lean that shows a bijective map has an inverse. I will research this.</p>
<p>Now, the proof of the theorem: This much should be the easy part. all I have to do is define the map in F called f_g(x) = g*x, and show that the set of <code>f_g for all g in G</code> is a subgroup of F. That should be simple once I've gotten through the preliminaries.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this looks about right for what I'll end up implementing in Lean. Any tips on how to get started with the preliminaries, or any hints/tips about subtleties in Lean I might be missing would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have just discovered that the way permutations are defined includes an inverse</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused by your list. You saw <code>perm S</code>, right?  There is also <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/group_action.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/group_action.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/group_action.lean</a></p>

<p>yes, I saw perm S. This sort of trivialises some of my workload</p>

<p>I did not see group_action.lean. I will study this file more and come back to this problem.</p>

<p>I'm very much aware of how bad is our documentation, but we still have lists of files visible on GitHub and on your hard drive. That file is not so well hidden in a folder named <code>group_theory</code>...</p>
