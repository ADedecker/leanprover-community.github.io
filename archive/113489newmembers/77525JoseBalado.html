<p>Hi, I am Jose, working as a web developer with a degree in Philosophy and interested in Mathematical Logic. I recently learned about Automatic Theorem Provers, and after trying several of them, Lean seamed like the easiest to install and run, with very good documentation.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Mathematical Logic is kid of basic and I am going through a tutorial called Theorem Proving in Lean, so I wonder if I could find somewhere the solutions for the exercises.<br>
Working right now with 3.6. Examples of Propositional Validities,  but I am strugling with this one, even if I was able to solve the previous problems:<br>
¬(p ∨ q) ↔ ¬p ∧ ¬q</p>
<p>I solved the previous one like this:<br>
example : ((p ∨ q) → r) ↔ (p → r) ∧ (q → r) := <br>
iff.intro<br>
(assume hpqr : (p ∨ q) → r, show (p → r) ∧ (q → r), from <br>
  ⟨(assume hp : p, show r, from hpqr(or.inl hp)), <br>
   (assume hq : q, show r, from hpqr(or.inr hq))⟩) <br>
(assume hprqr : (p → r) ∧ (q → r), show (p ∨ q) → r, from<br>
  (assume hpq : p ∨ q, show r, from<br>
    or.elim hpq<br>
    (assume hp : p, show r, from hprqr.left hp)<br>
    (assume hq : q, show r, from hprqr.right hq)<br>
  )<br>
)</p>
<p>So , please, any place where I could find the solutions, or perhaps anyone so kind as to show me how to prove this ¬(p ∨ q) ↔ ¬p ∧ ¬q.<br>
Also, not sure if it is right to post here these basic questions.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Jose</p>
