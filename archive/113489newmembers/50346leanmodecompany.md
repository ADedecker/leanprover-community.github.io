@**petercommand** if you have the goal window open, then sometimes it won't work.
Do you get any error or message?

I didn't get any errors when I first tried, but I am getting error messages (Company: backend company-lean error "interrupted" with args) now if the goal window is open. And closing the goal window worked :D
