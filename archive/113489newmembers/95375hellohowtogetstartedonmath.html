<p>Hi!<br>
My name is Matt!  I was a student of Johan DeJong's, have left academia to work in the tech industry, but have always been interested in formalizing math!  I heard about this project on Twitter and watched the seminar <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> gave at Microsoft.  I have been working my way through "Theorem Proving in Lean" to get familiar with the language/approach.  Is there a list of topics/issues in mathlib that I could think about in order to get started contributing to the (ambitious!) project of formalizing the undergraduate/graduate curriculum?  In other words - what's the best way to help with something that could possibly be useful?  I could randomly pick something, but I'm wondering if there's a more impactful path.</p>
