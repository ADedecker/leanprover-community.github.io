### [def k : set ℕ × ℕ := { (1, 2) }](60608defkset12.html)

This simple definition of a set (seems like it) should just work. But it doesn't.

```lean
def k : set ℕ × ℕ := { (1, 2) }. 
```
Instead it generates complaints about missing typeclass instances. Thoughts?

failed to synthesize type class instance for
⊢ has_emptyc (set ℕ × ℕ)

⊢ has_insert ?m_1 (set ℕ × ℕ)
singleton : Π {α γ : Type} [_inst_1 : has_emptyc γ] [_inst_2 : has_insert α γ], α → γ

`def k : set (ℕ × ℕ) := { (1, 2) }`

 Alas. Thx.
