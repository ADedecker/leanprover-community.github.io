Hiya, some of you probably know me from mathoverflow.  I was curious how things are going in here.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443347):
Hey, welcome! Good to see you.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443353):
Things are going pretty good here (-;

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443394):
I'm a complete noob on the whole theorem proving thing, but I feel like it's something worth learning

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443395):
One of our biggest problems is lack of (wo)man-power

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443397):
I'd like to eventually work on the library for simplicial sets, but I'm completely worthless at programming

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443404):
Right. The first thing you need to learn is that you should ask lots of questions here :lol:

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443406):
You don't need that much programming experience. Coincidentally, I did some stuff on simplicial sets a couple of months ago.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443409):
In the mean time, Scott wrote a very *very* nice category library.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443451):
Does it have Grothendieck constructions

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443452):
I've been meaning to update my stuff, but haven't done so yet.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443456):
It only has the basics so far. We are in the process of adding limits and colimits.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443457):
If it does, maybe it's already time to introduce the Theta construction that I use in my research

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443460):
Ah, ok!

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443467):
For example: we don't have abelian categories yet.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443472):
If there's a simplicial library and a category theory library, you might be able to use simplicial objects in Cat to get monoidal categories

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443477):
No fundamental obstructions. Just that there are only 3 people working on this in their spare time.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443481):
via Segal's observation

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443483):
Also, are Abelian categories really that fundamental for theorem proving?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443531):
Practice seems to show that theorem provers need a delicate balance between hands-on constructions and big theoretical hammers.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443537):
Not for theorem proving, but they are for applying theorem provers to (some, eg my) mathematical research.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443539):
mhm, do you know where I can get bootstrapped with experience to start contributing?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443547):
First you need to install a Lean environment.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443550):
What editor do you use to type LaTeX and the likes?

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443552):
vscode

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443554):
Great!

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443556):
There is a Lean extension for VScode

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443599):
Is the Windows lean environment crippled?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443603):
Install it, and open an empty Lean file. It will then ask if you want it to install Lean for you.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443607):
oh, that's neat!

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443608):
I think it was fixed. I am not sure. I haven't touched Windows in 10 years.

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443611):
If you like textbooks I would recommend Theorem Proving in Lean

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443612):
Maybe it is about to be fixed.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443621):
If it's not working, I have the Win10 Linux emulator installed

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443623):
that's why I'm asking

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443628):
Lean on Windows works great

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443676):
@**Harry Gindi**  [here](https://gist.github.com/kckennylau/611cc453c67df074ad492b4939ddd356) is my (controversal) instructions on how to get Lean on windows

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443677):
There are some issues with setting $PATH correctly. However, if you are the kind of person to have WSL installed, I'm sure you'll be able to fix it

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443688):
Thanks!

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443694):
oh wait, you said you're working in Linux, never mind then

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443695):
Both work, Kenny.  WSL is slow though

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443736):
Disk I/O is extremely bad

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443738):
then again, so is mingw64 =D

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443739):
what do you mean?

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443745):
iirc disk i/o on cygwin and msys is benchmarked just as slow as WSL

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443746):
it's the main reason why things are so slow.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443785):
I was really active on the WSL github for like two years, and performance is on-par with linux now except for disk i/o

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443792):
@**Harry Gindi** Once you have Lean installed, you will want to fork https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/
Then you need to run `leanpkg build` in that directory. After that, get yourself some tea. Your computer will be warming your room for about an hour.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443793):
but I also used msys2 before, and it was even slower

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443794):
then what's the best one?

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443797):
Kenny Lau, meh, nothing's great.  The best thing you could do probably is run a VM

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443798):
if you're concerned about performance

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443800):
Thanks Johan!

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443841):
I compile Lean with MSYS2, disk i/o is far from the limiting factor when it comes to performance

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443842):
and you need to rewarm your room for an hour every time you update mathlib, isn't Lean wonderful!

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443854):
Andrew Ashworth, then maybe performance on WSL is better than msys2 on everything but disk I/O

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443857):
@**Harry Gindi** ping

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443858):
hello!

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443860):
Harry Gindi, not ping

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443862):
I'm aware, I'm just using the web UI

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443863):
is it now? I can't imagine there being a huge difference

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443904):
Andrew, they did benchmarks on phoronix, and on cpu-only tasks, WSL performs at 95-100% of native

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443905):
once it hits disk i/o, it crashes to like 20%

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443914):
it has to do with the fact that NTFS doesn't use inodes and therefore can't cache them effectively

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443957):
also, windows defender, and a bunch of other things just kill it on disk i/o

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443960):
anyway, going to get this lean system installed

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443962):
does arch have a lean-git AUR package?

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443971):
Looks like it does

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443975):
ah, I was aware of that. I think you can compile Lean with visual studio and get a totally native binary, if i recall correctly

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443980):
i've never investigated it though, so ymmv

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443981):
blech, I have an arch installation on this pc

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443982):
disk access is not an issue at 20% or 100% anyway

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444022):
but every time I decide to jump into linux, I get sidetracked

I end up staying up all night messing around with it, it's unhealthy for me

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444034):
Don't use that arch thing.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444035):
oh, it's bad?

or are you saying don't use arch in general :D

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444043):
The VScode Lean extension is better. It sets up a useful wrapper called `elan`.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444045):
No, I run arch as OS :lol: So that's fine.

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444046):
the arch thing is just a lean system, I thought

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147444093):

@**Kenny Lau** I think https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/elan.md is a better place to direct computer-savvy Windows users to than your link

Yes --- please, please, everyone should now be using elan, no messing around with $PATH, no installing complicated things like msys2 or WSL, just go with the bare minimum provided by "git bash" and its installer, then work entirely inside VS Code.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 10 2018 at 22:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147448715):
@**Harry Gindi** ^^ that

Also hello, Kevin and Scott, it's been a while since I saw you on MO

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 10 2018 at 22:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147448815):
Here is a roadmap to getting started. First read through all of Theorem Proving In Lean and do all the exercises. Then choose a project to work on, and work on it.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 10 2018 at 22:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147448817):

Working with isomorphisms is difficult. Working with categories is even more difficult, for several reasons -- some associated with dependent type theory (it is difficult to transport structure along isomorphisms at this point, although things will change one day), some associated with universe issues (mathematicians being sloppy about universes, basically) and other things too

In that code I linked to, I am literally saying that a presheaf of types is a function F which takes a basis element to a type, plus a restriction F(U)->F(V), plus the axioms that res from U to U is id and res of res is res. So I am avoiding explicit usage of any category theory formalism.
