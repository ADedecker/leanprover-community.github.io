<p>Hiya, some of you probably know me from mathoverflow.  I was curious how things are going in here.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443347):
<p>Hey, welcome! Good to see you.</p>

<p>Things are going pretty good here (-;</p>

<p>I'm a complete noob on the whole theorem proving thing, but I feel like it's something worth learning</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443395):
<p>One of our biggest problems is lack of (wo)man-power</p>

<p>I'd like to eventually work on the library for simplicial sets, but I'm completely worthless at programming</p>

<p>Right. The first thing you need to learn is that you should ask lots of questions here <span class="emoji emoji-1f606" title="lol">:lol:</span></p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443406):
<p>You don't need that much programming experience. Coincidentally, I did some stuff on simplicial sets a couple of months ago.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443409):
<p>In the mean time, Scott wrote a very <em>very</em> nice category library.</p>

<p>Does it have Grothendieck constructions</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443452):
<p>I've been meaning to update my stuff, but haven't done so yet.</p>

<p>It only has the basics so far. We are in the process of adding limits and colimits.</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443457):
<p>If it does, maybe it's already time to introduce the Theta construction that I use in my research</p>

<p>For example: we don't have abelian categories yet.</p>

<p>If there's a simplicial library and a category theory library, you might be able to use simplicial objects in Cat to get monoidal categories</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443477):
<p>No fundamental obstructions. Just that there are only 3 people working on this in their spare time.</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443481):

<p>Also, are Abelian categories really that fundamental for theorem proving?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443531):
<p>Practice seems to show that theorem provers need a delicate balance between hands-on constructions and big theoretical hammers.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443537):
<p>Not for theorem proving, but they are for applying theorem provers to (some, eg my) mathematical research.</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443539):
<p>mhm, do you know where I can get bootstrapped with experience to start contributing?</p>

<p>First you need to install a Lean environment.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443550):
<p>What editor do you use to type LaTeX and the likes?</p>

<p>There is a Lean extension for VScode</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443599):
<p>Is the Windows lean environment crippled?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443603):
<p>Install it, and open an empty Lean file. It will then ask if you want it to install Lean for you.</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443607):
<p>oh, that's neat!</p>

<p>I think it was fixed. I am not sure. I haven't touched Windows in 10 years.</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Nov 10 2018 at 19:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147443611):
<p>If you like textbooks I would recommend Theorem Proving in Lean</p>

<p>If it's not working, I have the Win10 Linux emulator installed</p>

<p>There are some issues with setting $PATH correctly. However, if you are the kind of person to have WSL installed, I'm sure you'll be able to fix it</p>

<p>iirc disk i/o on cygwin and msys is benchmarked just as slow as WSL</p>

<p>I was really active on the WSL github for like two years, and performance is on-par with linux now except for disk i/o</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="137844">@Harry Gindi</span> Once you have Lean installed, you will want to fork <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/</a><br>
Then you need to run <code>leanpkg build</code> in that directory. After that, get yourself some tea. Your computer will be warming your room for about an hour.</p>

<p>Kenny Lau, meh, nothing's great.  The best thing you could do probably is run a VM</p>

<p>I compile Lean with MSYS2, disk i/o is far from the limiting factor when it comes to performance</p>

<p>Andrew, they did benchmarks on phoronix, and on cpu-only tasks, WSL performs at 95-100% of native</p>

<p>it has to do with the fact that NTFS doesn't use inodes and therefore can't cache them effectively</p>

<p>ah, I was aware of that. I think you can compile Lean with visual studio and get a totally native binary, if i recall correctly</p>

<p>Working with isomorphisms is difficult. Working with categories is even more difficult, for several reasons -- some associated with dependent type theory (it is difficult to transport structure along isomorphisms at this point, although things will change one day), some associated with universe issues (mathematicians being sloppy about universes, basically) and other things too</p>

<p>but when mathematicians wanted to actually use it to prove basic stuff like quadratic reciprocity or finite fields or whatever</p>

<p>For example, defining C^\infty functions requires you do have partial derivatives, which come from the 1-dimensional case, if I remember correctly (I haven't done analysis in around 8 years =\)</p>

<p>they found they really just wanted a much deeper theory of polynomials in one variable</p>

<p>so at the end of the day an undergraduate here at Imperial, Chris Hughes, just wrote the theory of polynomials in one variable anyway.</p>

<p>And I kind of suspect that the same might happen for differentiable functions.</p>

<p>Eventually we'll have them on Banach manifolds or something</p>

<p>oh, you're saying that you agree that the 1-variable case is separate and important</p>

<p>but then when someone wants to prove that the derivative of sin is cos (which we do not have at this point)</p>

<p>they will not want to work on a Banach manifold</p>

<p>it's not even meaningful on a banach manifold</p>

<p>the derivative of a map of manifolds is a map on tangent bundles</p>

<p>I know, I'm just saying that if you write general functions which work in some big generality then you will just end up constantly having to tell these functions to specialise to the case of the real numbers</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 22:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147449557):
<p>sure, yes</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 10 2018 at 22:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147449558):
<blockquote>

<p>right, and you'll then have to identify the tangent space of the reals with the reals etc</p>

<p>What I am saying is that in my opinion there is a need for a theory of functions in one real variable</p>

#### [ Harry Gindi (Nov 10 2018 at 22:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147449563):
<p>and that identification is not obvious without additional structure</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 10 2018 at 22:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Hello/near/147449564):
<p>I believe that there is a little about functions in one complex variable, somewhere in the modular forms work</p>

<p>I get ya!</p>

<p>I fully agree with this</p>

<p>there's almost always a distinguished most important 1-dimensional case of whatever</p>

<p>imagine if people tried to write the categories library starting with 2-categories</p>

<p>It's also why e.g. Lawvere's ETCC was dead on arrival</p>

<p>anyway, I'm going to give some of this a shot tomorrow morning</p>
