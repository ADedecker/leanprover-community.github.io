<p>This is probably a stupid question, but when I'm in tactics mode and I have an hypothesis of the form <code>h: a = b</code> and need one of the form <code>h: b = a</code> is there a simple result I can use with rw to just swap it round? I've tried <code>rw eq.symm a b at h</code> but that doesn't seem to do what I want here. I'm probably missing something really obvious.</p>
