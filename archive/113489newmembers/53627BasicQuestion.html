<p>I was wondering if I could get some help on a fairly basic question? I'm currently working on a project comparing Coq and Lean, and as part of it I'm coding basic group theory into both. I've adapted the code from Coq to Lean and it all seems fine, but breaks down when I start trying to prove further lemmas, I'm getting a "don't know how to synthesize placeholder" error. I know I'm missing something simple, could anyone point it out?</p>

<p>You can delete <code>[e : G]</code> from the <code>variables</code> line. You've already declared <code>e</code> as a component of <code>Group</code>.</p>

<p>That was in my original code, however when I don't declare it I get the error message</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>group.lean:21:34: error
type mismatch at application
  Op x e
term
  e
has type
  Π (G : Type) [c : Group G], G : Type 1
but is expected to have type
  G : Type
</pre></div>


<p>I'm assuming I've done something wrong when setting up the group axioms, but still can't see it?</p>

<p>Yes, this is the right place.</p>

<p>This sounds like a very bad way of comparing Coq and Lean. Directly translating a Coq file into a Lean file will simply prove that Lean is not good at being Coq. The same would work in the opposite direction. You should try to do the same math in idiomatic Coq and then in idiomatic Lean. Your definition of <code>Group</code> is nothing you would see in a Lean file</p>

<p>We would never write such a definition without inserting a notation for <code>Op</code> right after <code>(Op: G → (G → G))</code> (and we wouldn't put that many parentheses).</p>

<p>Dinner is calling, other people will probably rewrite your code.</p>

<p>Here's how I'd define groups from scratch in Lean: <a href="https://github.com/kbuzzard/group-theory-game/blob/master/src/group/definitions.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/kbuzzard/group-theory-game/blob/master/src/group/definitions.lean">https://github.com/kbuzzard/group-theory-game/blob/master/src/group/definitions.lean</a> . Check out the repo for the Lean idiomatic way to do things. Note: none of this <code>Op</code> stuff -- we use the standard notation <code>*</code> right from square 1.</p>

<p>Thank you both for the replies. I'll reread your code and start again from the top. I'd seen the link when searching earlier but avoided it at first as I was trying to use only definitions that I'd typed myself (as I'd had to do in Coq), but I'm definitely not treating the two distinctly enough. I'll try again, thank you!</p>
