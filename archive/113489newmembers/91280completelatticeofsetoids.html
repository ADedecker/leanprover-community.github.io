<p>Hi! I've written a small file of results about setoids that were generalisations of things I've written about congruence relations. <br>
It's at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/setoid_complete_lattice/src/data/setoid.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/setoid_complete_lattice/src/data/setoid.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/setoid_complete_lattice/src/data/setoid.lean</a> and it's got stuff like the complete lattice of setoids on a type, results about the inductively defined equivalence closure of a binary relation, <code>eqv_gen</code>, and the analogues of some isomorphism theorems for quotients of arbitrary types. <br>
I'd like to try and make it PR-able if it's deemed useful.</p>
<p>I'm assuming there's a reason there's no coercion from <code>setoid α</code> to <code>α → α → Prop</code>; is</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">r&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">setoid</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">@</span><span class="n">setoid</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="bp">_</span> <span class="n">r</span>
</pre></div>


<p>a sensible alternative if I want to easily talk about different setoids on the same type?</p>
<p>I'd like to add to the file if there's more that should be there, and I realise it might be better off without the lemmas about kernels, split into sections and put in existing appropriate files.</p>

<p>Johannes suggested adding that <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/690#issuecomment-461548464" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/690#issuecomment-461548464">here</a>, and I would happily close that PR in favor of something built off what you're putting together.</p>

<p>For the latest <em>Proving for Fun</em> problem set we also had different setoids on a single type. I think it's very welcome to have better support for that. I would maybe call it <code>setoid.rel</code> instead of <code>setoid.r'</code>.</p>

<p>+1 from me. Projection notation to the win! <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="118107">@Amelia Livingston</span> With the suggestion of Floris, we would be able to type <code>foo.rel</code> to access the relation, for <code>foo : setoid X</code>.</p>
