<p>I was wondering if anyone might have advice on a learning path for getting to the point of being able to make useful contributions to the goal of easing the use of computer proof assistants like Lean. I have spent some time studying mathematical logic, primarily from "First Order Mathematical Logic" by Angelo Margaris, and I have started going through "Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism" by Morten Heine SÃ¸rensen and Pawel Urzyczyn (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC" target="_blank" title="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC">https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC</a>). In some respects there seems to be a bit of a catch-22 here, having the mathematics from these texts available in a fully formalized fashion would be an aid to understanding them, but first needing that understanding to formalize them or to understand their formalization. Nevertheless, I am making progress in these, but it is time consuming, so I would like to be sure that it is a good approach. I am also curious as to the kind of open problems in the field.</p>

<p>My strategy was : read Theorem Proving In Lean, think of some hard problems, try to solve them, get stuck, ask loads of questions here, and then people start realising where the true bottlenecks are</p>

<p>I do not specifically know those texts but that seems like a good approach. You have to be ok with things being slow at first</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  Did you already know type theory and logic before you did so?</p>

<p>Would it be useful, apart from my own learning, for me to try and formalize the latter book in Lean?</p>

<p>I don't think you need to know any of those if your goal is to "make Lean easier to use"</p>

<p>TBH if you're looking for a textbook Coq has way more mindshare at the moment, you may work through Software Foundations and some of the harder exercises in CPDT in Coq. At that point you're a year or two in and a whiz, and then you come back and pick up Lean since most things are similar...</p>

<p>I would say also most people don't use Lean/Coq to implement programs because specifying and proving program behavior is exceedingly tedious</p>

<p>unit tests in regular programming languages are already seen as a chore</p>

<p>anything which reduces the burden of writing proofs is ultimately what's needed; that means automatic proof search, better lemma and theorem search &amp; autocomplete, code linting, etc etc etc</p>

<p>none of those things really require a back to front knowledge of type theory / curry-howard isomorphism / etc</p>
