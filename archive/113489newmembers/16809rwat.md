#### [Ali Sever (Aug 01 2018 at 15:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130715172):
If I have `h : a = b`, and I want to get rid of all the `a`s  in my hypotheses, I use `rw h at *`. But sometimes some are unaffected, and I have to manually go through them, using `rw h at h37`. Am I doing something wrong or is there a better way?

`subst h`

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 01 2018 at 23:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130742552):
That didn't work.

#### [Simon Hudon (Aug 01 2018 at 23:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130742974):
I think that should be `subst a`

#### [Simon Hudon (Aug 01 2018 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130742978):
(if a is a variable)

#### [Kenny Lau (Aug 01 2018 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130742985):
nah, it's `subst h`

#### [Simon Hudon (Aug 01 2018 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130743052):
Alternatively, `simp only [h] at *` might help

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 23:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/130743727):
both `subst a` and `subst h` should work

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 11 2018 at 22:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131967570):
Can someone explain why the following doesn't work?
```lean
variables (α β : Type) (f : α  → α → Prop) (g : α → α)
variables (a p : α)

example (h : f a a) (h1 : p = a) (h2 : g p = a) : f p (g p) :=
begin
-- exact h1.symm ▸ h2.symm ▸ h (doesn't work)
exact h2.symm ▸ h1.symm ▸ h
end
```

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Aug 11 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131967688):
Try `refine h1.symm ▸ _` (instead of exact).  Then you see the expected type Lean uses to elaborate `h2.symm ▸ h` and you'll see why it doesn't work.

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 11 2018 at 22:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131967774):
If I have `q`instead of `g p`, the order doesn't matter, why does `g p` including `p` change how it works?

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 11 2018 at 22:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131967915):
Isn't there a way to make subst only work once?

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Aug 11 2018 at 22:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131968029):
It works with `q` instead of `g p` because `q` does not contain `p`.  No, when `▸` is elaborated, all occurrences of the lhs are replaced in the expected type.  In a sense `h ▸ _` in term mode does pretty much the same as `rw ← h` in tactic mode.

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 11 2018 at 22:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131968039):

Except for obeying.

Can someone help me to prove that a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c , seems that mul_comm cannot work here

#### [Scott Morrison (Aug 12 2018 at 00:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131970633):
Have you tried `ring`? <--- oops, this won't work: this is me being a mathematician and forgetting "ring" doesn't mean "commutative ring".

#### [Scott Morrison (Aug 12 2018 at 00:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131970641):
You can also use `conv` to restrict where the `rw` acts.

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 12 2018 at 00:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131970840):
`ring` will work if you assume `comm_ring` instance

#### [Scott Morrison (Aug 12 2018 at 00:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131970884):
oh, that's cool, I hadn't known that!

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 12 2018 at 00:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131971004):
```lean
import tactic.ring

example {α : Type*} [comm_ring α] {a b c d : α} :  a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c := 
by ring

example {α : Type*} [comm_ring α] {a b c d : α} :  a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c := 
begin
  rw mul_comm,
  rw add_comm,
  rw mul_comm,
  rw add_comm
end

example {α : Type*} [comm_ring α] {a b c d : α} :  a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c := 
begin
  conv {
      to_lhs,
      congr,
      rw mul_comm,
      skip,
      rw mul_comm,
  }
end

example {α : Type*} [comm_ring α] {a b c d : α} :  a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c :=

  conv {
      for (a*b) [1] { rw mul_comm },
      for (c*d) [1] { rw mul_comm },

The second one is a bit silly, but fun

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 03:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131975463):
I often use partial specification to describe where to rewrite, although this doesn't always work and then you can use the `conv` approach
```
example {α : Type*} [comm_ring α] {a b c d : α} :  a * b + c * d = b * a + d * c :=
by rw [mul_comm, mul_comm c]
```

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 03:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131975469):
Also, `by simp [mul_comm]` works

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 12 2018 at 03:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131975512):
@**Scott Morrison** In fact `ring` is *only* for commutative (semi)rings. Perhaps I should have put `comm` in the name but I don't have any idea how to normalize a noncommutative ring

#### [Scott Morrison (Aug 12 2018 at 03:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/131975517):
Perhaps we should put `noncomm_` in the name of a noncommutative ring. :-)

#### [JIANXIONG SUN (Aug 12 2018 at 17:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132002007):
Oh, I see, thank you very much

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 14 2018 at 20:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132126762):
How would one check to see which lemmas simp used? I want to suppress one of them.

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 14 2018 at 20:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132127189):
`set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true`

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 19 2018 at 13:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132401970):
Is it impractical to have a tactic/function that does eq.subst with def eq things?

#### [Kenny Lau (Aug 19 2018 at 14:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132402856):
I don't think that's computable.

#### [Simon Hudon (Aug 19 2018 at 17:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132409890):
@**Ali Sever** Do you know about `dsimp` and `simp!`?

@**Kenny Lau** do you think it's uncomputable because def equality is not transitive? That doesn't matter as long as the language is strongly normalizing: every definition is guaranteed to terminate

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 19 2018 at 17:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410176):
I want to be able to do something in the lines of `exact q ▸ h`, but I have to do
```lean
suffices : a = b,
  exact this ▸ h,
exact q,
```
where `q`is def eq to a proof of `a = b`.

#### [Chris Hughes (Aug 19 2018 at 17:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410344):
You can do `(show a = b, from q) ▸ h`

#### [Ali Sever (Aug 19 2018 at 17:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410562):
I guess that's close enough, but I'm still wondering why it isn't its own function.

#### [Chris Hughes (Aug 19 2018 at 17:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410586):
you might be able to try `erw q`

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 19 2018 at 17:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410896):
I would be curious to know whether that ever works; I've only seen `erw` see through definitional equalities in the goal/hypothesis to be rewritten

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 19 2018 at 17:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132410966):
It does seem like `rw` could try to reduce the rule until it is at least of the form `_ = _`, if it isn't already of that form

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 19 2018 at 17:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/rw%20at%20%2A/near/132411016):
Or `iff`
