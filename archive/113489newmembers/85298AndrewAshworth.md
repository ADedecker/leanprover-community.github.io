Testing... is this thing on?

I was hoping to be first!

So I need to reply to threads explicitly?

This is a teeny tiny bit less seamless than what I am generally used to.

And apparently I accidentally Andrew'd my last message.

It seems like it will make it easier to have multiple discussions at the same time

I like your optimism! :)

:D

If it doesn't, Leo will just do Lean++ and try again ;).

Or maybe he'll move on. I'm hoping that if Lean doesn't catch on, it will be because something better came along

Oh yes, I am Ferinko. I just failed to use my dummy github account for Zulip.

Now we're split across multiple channels ...

Surely you didn't think I'm Moses Schoenfinkel! :)

Yeah the split is the thing I am worried about as well.

I don't sanitize the names that I learn. As long as your name doesn't include an end quote, I'll learn it :P
