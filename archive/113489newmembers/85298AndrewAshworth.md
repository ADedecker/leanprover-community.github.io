<p>Testing... is this thing on?</p>

<p>I was hoping to be first!</p>

<p>So I need to reply to threads explicitly?</p>

<p>This is a teeny tiny bit less seamless than what I am generally used to.</p>

<p>And apparently I accidentally Andrew'd my last message.</p>

<p>It seems like it will make it easier to have multiple discussions at the same time</p>

<p>I like your optimism! :)</p>

<p>If it doesn't, Leo will just do Lean++ and try again ;).</p>

<p>Or maybe he'll move on. I'm hoping that if Lean doesn't catch on, it will be because something better came along</p>

<p>Oh yes, I am Ferinko. I just failed to use my dummy github account for Zulip.</p>

<p>Now we're split across multiple channels ...</p>

#### [ Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 26 2018 at 17:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Andrew%20Ashworth/near/123002764):
<p>Surely you didn't think I'm Moses Schoenfinkel! :)</p>

<p>Yeah the split is the thing I am worried about as well.</p>

<p>I don't sanitize the names that I learn. As long as your name doesn't include an end quote, I'll learn it :P</p>
