Testing... is this thing on?

I was hoping to be first!

So I need to reply to threads explicitly?

This is a teeny tiny bit less seamless than what I am generally used to.

And apparently I accidentally Andrew'd my last message.

It seems like it will make it easier to have multiple discussions at the same time

I like your optimism! :)

If it doesn't, Leo will just do Lean++ and try again ;).

Or maybe he'll move on. I'm hoping that if Lean doesn't catch on, it will be because something better came along

Oh yes, I am Ferinko. I just failed to use my dummy github account for Zulip.

Now we're split across multiple channels ...

#### [Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 26 2018 at 17:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new%20members/topic/Andrew%20Ashworth/near/123002764):
Surely you didn't think I'm Moses Schoenfinkel! :)

Yeah the split is the thing I am worried about as well.

I don't sanitize the names that I learn. As long as your name doesn't include an end quote, I'll learn it :P
