<p>I.e. is there a way to write <code>simp [‚Üêlemma, lemma, lemma]</code>?</p>

<p><code>simp [(lemma).symm, lemma, lemma]</code></p>

<p>That doesn't always work, though. For instance, I'm trying to do <code>simp [(polynomial.sum_C_mul_X_eq p).symm, finsupp.sum, polynomial.derivative_sum],</code> -- rewrites work, but <code>simp</code> doesn't.</p>

<p><code>simp</code> might be taking a wrong turn before it tries the rewrites you want. Switch logging on if you want to investigate further -- see the <code>simp</code> docs in mathlib for an explanation of how to do this.</p>
