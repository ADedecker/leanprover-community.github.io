### [Is there a way to complicate things with simp?](72652Isthereawaytocomplicatethingswithsimp.html)

I.e. is there a way to write `simp [‚Üêlemma, lemma, lemma]`?

`simp [(lemma).symm, lemma, lemma]`

That doesn't always work, though. For instance, I'm trying to do `simp [(polynomial.sum_C_mul_X_eq p).symm, finsupp.sum, polynomial.derivative_sum],` -- rewrites work, but `simp` doesn't.

`simp` might be taking a wrong turn before it tries the rewrites you want. Switch logging on if you want to investigate further -- see the `simp` docs in mathlib for an explanation of how to do this.
