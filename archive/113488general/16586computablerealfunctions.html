<p>Let R denote the Dedekind reals. I know that constructively it is consistent that all functions R -&gt; R are continuous. In the other direction, what functions R -&gt; R definitely are computable? I assume polynomials are; what about the exponential function for example? Or any function which provably grows faster than any polynomial?</p>

<p>There are various notions of computability for infinitary objects. There is a survey overview of the history here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3431.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3431.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3431.pdf</a>, and Section 2.9 has some of the relevant definitions. (Even more complications arise when you start talking about partial functions.)</p>
<p>The most common and useful definition is called "Type II computability." Roughly, a function f(x) is type II computable if there is an algorithm which, given as input a function representing a Cauchy sequence of rationals converging to x with an explicit rate of convergence, computes arbitrarily good approximations to f(x). Any reasonable computable function will have this property.</p>
<p>Once can also talk about complexity bounded computation, like primitive recursive functions on the reals and polynomial time computable functions on the reals. That gets messy. But for the most basic notion of computability, the basic intuitions work pretty well: if you can compute arbitrarily good approximations to the output given the ability to query arbitrarily good approximation to the input, the function is computable.</p>

<p>I guess I specifically mean the one in the HoTT book, but it's also one I've seen elsewhere. A Dedekind real is a pair of <code>L : Q -&gt; Prop</code> and <code>U : Q -&gt; Prop</code> which satisfy some axioms which mean they look like <code>({q | q &lt; r}, {q | q &gt; r})</code>.</p>

<p>For something like the exponential function, which is differentiable everywhere and computable on cauchy sequences, it seems there is no problem computing it on dedekind reals either</p>

<p>Oh, sorry, I missed the "Dedekind" part. Ignore everything I said. Even though some people like Dedekind reals, I find them really unnatural to think about computationally.</p>

<p>Hopefully it's obvious that two Cauchy sequences with the same terms but different rates of convergence converge to the same Dedekind real</p>

<p>then at least if <code>Prop</code> really means subsingletons like in HoTT, then I think I'm done. Since I can pick some rational lower and upper bounds, use those to construct the Cauchy sequence, and then prove that the result doesn't depend on the choice of bounds.</p>

<p>Hey, I don't mind questions about constructive maths in maths. Constructive maths is definitely a part of maths. It's a very specialized part of math, and you don't expect to find it represented in most math departments (or even expect most mathematicians to have heard of it). But that's fine, everybody is allowed to be interested in arcane maths. What is less pleasant is people preaching that all mathematics should be constructive. But most of all, what I would really really find sad would be to make mathlib less useful to mathematicians in order to make it more constructive. We already have mathcomp in Coq for this.</p>

<p>I'll use the word "computable" here since that is my wheelhouse, but this should also hold for any notion of "constructive" that is worth its weight in salt.  There is a mysterious and magical (please don't burn me at the stake!), but altogether real principle: Every <strong>natural</strong> real number and <strong>natural</strong> real continuous function is computable.  Period.  The proof might not be known, but it is and you should just accept that it is and look for the proof.  This means that exponential functions, polynomials, super exponential functions, integrals of natural continuous functions, integrals of natural measurable functions, your favorite continuous function from undergrad, and so on are computable.  Now, proving that it is computable might take a bit of work, but usually that work is just following the classical proof that the function is continuous.  After working out a few examples, you get the hang of it.  <strong>I don't say this (just) to be polemic.  This principle had a profound positive effect on my research.  I stopped worrying if real functions were computable and figured either someone else already showed they were or that I could prove it easily when I got to the point I needed that fact.</strong><br>
Here is some clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am sure you are trying to think of counterexamples, but I would wager good money you can't find any.  One can debate the definition of "natural" here, but there are some obvious things which aren't.  You can't just plug in a non-natural non-computable number into continuous function with parameters.  All parameters (for example, coefficients in polynomials) need to be filled in with natural real numbers (or you can talk about the theorem which says that for all parameters the resulting function is computable uniformly relative to the parameters).  Also, you can't do some arbitrary encoding of the Turing machines (which are already arbitrarily encoded) or Hilbert's tenth problem.  (If there was a natural encoding that would be another matter, but my point is that such natural encodings don't exist.)</li>
<li>This is not an obviously principle as far as I can tell.  It fits in the same uncomfortable zone as the Church-Turing thesis where it is not a theorem, and probably can't be formalized, but it sure seems true (and is quite useful).</li>
<li>This principle is special to real (and complex) functions.  For functions from natural numbers to natural numbers (of which all are continuous), there are clear examples of natural functions (for example Hilbert's 10th problem) which are not computable.</li>
<li>Here is a special application of my principle.  It is not proven yet <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/249617/is-the-area-of-the-mandelbrot-provably-computable" target="_blank" title="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/249617/is-the-area-of-the-mandelbrot-provably-computable">if the area of the Mandelbrot set is computable</a>.  Regardless, my principle says it is.</li>
</ul>
