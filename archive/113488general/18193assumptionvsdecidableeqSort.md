### [assumption vs decidable_eq Sort*](18193assumptionvsdecidableeqSort.html)

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 01 2018 at 08:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/assumption vs decidable_eq Sort*/near/134952908):
How does `assumption` work if we don't have `decidable_eq Sort*`?

`assumption` is `meta`. So it does not compare propositions on the logic level, but at the level of expressions.
