<p>Apparently <code>p -&gt; q</code> is syntax for <code>\Pi (a : p), q</code>, including binding <code>a</code> in <code>q</code>? How did I never notice this before?</p>

<p>Now I understand why Patrick used to complain about variables named <code>a</code>...</p>

<p>This is only true inside tactics. In term mode the variable is called <code>_x</code> I think</p>

<p>Whaaaat</p>

<p>but it is smart and doesn't bind <code>_x</code> in the rhs</p>
