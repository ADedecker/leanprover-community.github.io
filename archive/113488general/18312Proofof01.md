Hi guys, I'm sure I've asked this before, but I can't recall/ find my previous question.

How does one prove in lean that 1 ≠ 0?

I vaguely remember there was a lemma somewhere in the library, which allowed to magically prove these things, but can't find it either!

It depends! Are these natural numbers? :)

`zero_ne_one`

Cheers guys! Yes, I meant natural numbers

Right. In general, `1 ≠ 0`is `1 = 0 → false` and `1 = 0` as an assumption is untrue because of `no_confusion` (which appears to be a source of confusion!).

@**Mario Carneiro** what on Earth, there's a `zero_ne_one_class` o_O?

I think that class is misguided, since it doesn't play well with the rest of the hierarchy. It's one of those ossified things that will eventually go away when the alg hierarchy changes

I guess that's because it's only true for some rings...

The problem is that it was intended as a mixin (who cares about an arbitrary structure with two unequal elements named 0 and 1 and no other laws?) but structure mixins don't work like this anymore

Ok, reading the source, `zero_ne_one` effectively boils down to

```
example : (0  ≠  1) :=  λ h, nat.no_confusion h
```

Is it generally true that given any two *different* terms, generated by applying different constructors or constructors in different order of `some_inductive_type`

```
inductive  some_inductive_type : Type
| constructor_a : ...
| constructor_b : ...
```

`some_inductive_type.no_confusion` will be able  to distinguish between them?

yes, that's its main purpose. The other purpose is that `no_confusion`, acting on the same constructors, gives back equalities of the constructor arguments

Thanks @**Mario Carneiro**  and @**Moses Schönfinkel** , this is very clear now.

No worries. It's basically information one recovers from the fact that constructors for any given inductive type are disjoint and injective.

I am confused about why Mario is surprised. 0 ne 1 is an axiom in some structures e.g. integral domains, which extend rings, so we surely expect to see these silly typeclasses for the same reason we see distribs. What am I missing?

distrib is also a silly typeclass which doesn't serve its intended purpose

Is this something to do with the old structure command? Are these silly typeclasses going to disappear in Lean 4 perhaps?

I am certain they'll be gone by the time Lean 7 is out.
