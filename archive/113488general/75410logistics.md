Is there a way to move messages from one thread to another in here?

Nice! Thanks! So I moved you with me. I'm still in "general" though but I think it's a good tool

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Feb 26 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005192):
Ah, you can also edit the topic text directly

Haha, what's with that message height

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005316):
I think it may be unique to you because you're a moderator / organizer

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005320):
(not the height but the option to rename topics)

Yeah, I suspected so. Even if you can still  move all messages, huh.

at some point, if we decide to stay here, we should update https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/

Futurama is so good I have had no time left for The Simpsons.

What about before Futurama showed up?
