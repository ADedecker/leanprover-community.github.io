<p>Nice! Thanks! So I moved you with me. I'm still in "general" though but I think it's a good tool</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Feb 26 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005192):
<p>Ah, you can also edit the topic text directly</p>

<p>Haha, what's with that message height</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005316):

<p>at some point, if we decide to stay here, we should update <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/">https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/</a></p>
