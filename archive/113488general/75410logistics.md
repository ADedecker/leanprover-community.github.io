Is there a way to move messages from one thread to another in here?

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Feb 26 2018 at 18:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005077):
Try editing the message

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005160):
Nice! Thanks! So I moved you with me. I'm still in "general" though but I think it's a good tool

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Feb 26 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005192):
Ah, you can also edit the topic text directly

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005249):
I don't see that option

Haha, what's with that message height

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005316):
I think it may be unique to you because you're a moderator / organizer

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005320):
(not the height but the option to rename topics)

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Feb 26 2018 at 18:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005366):
Yeah, I suspected so. Even if you can still  move all messages, huh.

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005543):

at some point, if we decide to stay here, we should update https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005677):
... unless ... we want this to be our "no girls allowed" treehouse ...

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005811):
No fans of the Simpsons here?

#### [Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 26 2018 at 18:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005964):
Futurama is so good I have had no time left for The Simpsons.

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005968):
What about before Futurama showed up?

#### [Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 26 2018 at 18:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123005981):
Tom&Jerry, of course

#### [Simon Hudon (Feb 26 2018 at 18:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/logistics/near/123006208):
