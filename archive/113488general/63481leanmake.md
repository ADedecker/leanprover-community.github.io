When I rebuild mathlib, I get the impression that it is recreating olean files for all lean files, even if they (and their dependencies) were not touched since the last build. Is that impression correct?

Only touched files will be recompiled.  Touched = changed modification time.

I think it recompiles anything that depends on a file that changed, so if there's a change in `nat.basic` that pretty much means everything is recompiled.

Is this normal? This is on my (t)rusty Thinkpad X61 with > 3GB of free RAM. Does this mean I'm doomed to replace it?

It only takes 7 minutes here.  This is with a i7-6700K and 16G RAM (not that it matters).

That's with 8 threads?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Aug 17 2018 at 08:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lean%20--make/near/132285607):
The cpu has only 4 cores.  Each core can run two threads (via hyperthreading), but that doesn't improve performance by much.

That's on my (still rather ancient) server with 8 cores. I'll see if I can offload compilation to this mammoth.

did that actually take an hour or 7 minutes

The `user` time is measured across all cores and threads.

have you tried running with the `-j` option?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Aug 18 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lean%20--make/near/132357406):
How would `-j` help?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Aug 18 2018 at 13:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lean%20--make/near/132357463):
```shell
[jmc@atarrimbo mathlib]$ echo $((7*16))
112
```
So there were 16 threads running almost full-time for 7 minutes.

```
I guess these are about 10 years old. All those modern i7's probably beat 4 of these hands-down. And I have only 16 of them. So if you have a quad-core...

Mario, did you ever time a fresh build of mathlib on your hardware?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 18 2018 at 14:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lean%20--make/near/132357706):
I'll get back to you in an hour

Ok cool. But why is `user` equal to `0`? What OS do you have?

I wish `lean --make` could have some debugging output, like at least how many files have been compiled

It actually does print a bunch of output, just apparently not on Windows? I was really confused when I tried Lean on a Windows machine for the first time and `lean --make` was silent

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Nov 01 2018 at 14:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lean%20--make/near/136920069):
It prints a bunch of output on my windows machine with the latest nightly. With April nightly it didn't

Interesting. I think I was using 3.4.1.

I already `git pull`ed

I have to use `winpty lean --make` on msys2 to get output

I think the terminal detection is broken
