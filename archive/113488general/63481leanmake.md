<p>When I rebuild mathlib, I get the impression that it is recreating olean files for all lean files, even if they (and their dependencies) were not touched since the last build. Is that impression correct?</p>

<p>Only touched files will be recompiled.  Touched = changed modification time.</p>

<p>I think it recompiles anything that depends on a file that changed, so if there's a change in <code>nat.basic</code> that pretty much means everything is recompiled.</p>

<p>Is this normal? This is on my (t)rusty Thinkpad X61 with &gt; 3GB of free RAM. Does this mean I'm doomed to replace it?</p>

<p>The cpu has only 4 cores.  Each core can run two threads (via hyperthreading), but that doesn't improve performance by much.</p>

<p>That's on my (still rather ancient) server with 8 cores. I'll see if I can offload compilation to this mammoth.</p>

<p>did that actually take an hour or 7 minutes</p>

<p>So there were 16 threads running almost full-time for 7 minutes.</p>

<p>I guess these are about 10 years old. All those modern i7's probably beat 4 of these hands-down. And I have only 16 of them. So if you have a quad-core...</p>

<p>Mario, did you ever time a fresh build of mathlib on your hardware?</p>

<p>I wish <code>lean --make</code> could have some debugging output, like at least how many files have been compiled</p>

<p>It actually does print a bunch of output, just apparently not on Windows? I was really confused when I tried Lean on a Windows machine for the first time and <code>lean --make</code> was silent</p>

<p>It prints a bunch of output on my windows machine with the latest nightly. With April nightly it didn't</p>

<p>I have to use <code>winpty lean --make</code> on msys2 to get output</p>
