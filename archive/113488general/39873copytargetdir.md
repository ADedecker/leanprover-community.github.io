<p>I really don't understand how the <code>_target</code> directory works</p>

<p>I want to help Kevin so I clone his repo</p>

<p>Of course it depends on mathlib</p>

<p>So I try to copy <code>_target</code> from my own projects to avoid compiling mathlib</p>

<p>and it doesn't seem to work</p>

<p>or maybe it does</p>

<p>it seemed like VScode was taking forever to compile</p>

<p>which seemed like it was compiling lots of files</p>

<p>but maybe it was only Kevin's code</p>

<p>I have symlinked the <code>_target</code> dir before. It seems to work fine.</p>
