<p>Is it possible to formulate and prove in Lean (together with the univalence axiom from homotopy type theory) the statement<br>
"Isomorphic groups have the same (structural) properties."<br>
Or is this just like a meta property that cannot be formulated in Lean?</p>
<p>Of course, one could formulate the statement not only for groups, but for any kind of structure.</p>

<p>The univalence axiom is inconsistent with proof irrelevence which is baked into Lean's logic. I think with parametricity theorems we may be able to prove this kind of result. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> might have to chime in to confirm.</p>

<p>Okay. But in general (without proof irrelevance), would it be possible in type theory to formulate/formalize statements such as<br>
"Isomorphic groups have the same (structural) properties."?<br>
Or are such statements rather meta properties?<br>
I guess that in ZFC, the above statement is not formalizable, because it is not possible to quantify over properties (let alone define what a <em>structural</em> property). So my hope is that the statement is formalizable in type theory, because in type theory, properties are mathematical objects. Also, in type theory, all properties are structural properties, I think.<br>
Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask this question.</p>

<p>Here is a property of groups: let <code>G</code> be a group. My property for groups <code>H</code> is: <code>H = G</code>.<br>
This is true for the group <code>G</code>, but not in general for arbitary groups <code>H</code> that are merely isomorphic to <code>G</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, in HoTT you can easily prove  that isomorphic groups have the same properties. The formal statement could be something like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>∀(G H : Group), G ≅ H → ∀(P : G → Prop), P G ↔ P H
</pre></div>


<p>Note that <code>G</code> and <code>H</code> share all properties that can be expressed in the type theory. This might look a bit weird from a set-theoretic perspective: <code>G</code> and <code>H</code> could have different elements. However, in type theory you cannot really express that.</p>
<p>Aside: with <code>Prop</code> above I mean all types that have at most 1 element. You can replace <code>Prop</code> by <code>Type</code> and the statement would still be true.</p>

<p>I don't really have time right now to start playing with this Voevodsky stuff where you work in Coq and have this extra axiom. Is there a way of doing this sort of stuff in Lean 3? Lean 4?</p>

<p>I went out for a meal this week with a strong algebraist and I asked him to prove that if R and S were isomorphic rings and R was Gorenstein then S was Gorenstein and he simply did not know where to start. He said it was obvious.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of univalence conjecture that one can formalise in Lean? Stating that for all structures in a certain typeclass this basic property of "being the same" manages to permeate through -- the correct notion of equiv.</p>

<p>I don't know enough about Lean to formalise something like this, but I think cheeky way to circumvent this is start with the proposition above by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> as the definition of isomorphic mathematical structures, rather than an axiom. However, I don't know that such a definition would lend itself to being useful to Lean.</p>

<p>Ask a research mathematician who doesn't know anything about schemes the following question: "Say X and Y are schemes, and X and Y are isomorphic. Say X is affine. Do you think Y is also affine?". They would answer "yeah, probably. "</p>

<p>I know very little about schemes, despite my advisor being an algebraic geometer. However, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that two isomorphic schemes would both be affine if one is.</p>

<p>Because schemes have a certain public interface which is mathematician-acceptable; there's a topological space, there's a functor from the open sets, but there's definitely no looking at elements of the topological space -- those are "unopenable sets" -- I think they're more like terms in type theory (terms that aren't types).</p>
