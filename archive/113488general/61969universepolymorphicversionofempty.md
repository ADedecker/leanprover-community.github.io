### [universe polymorphic version of empty?](61969universepolymorphicversionofempty.html)

RT? The current empty is at Type 0

just don't want to reinvent the wheel.
Also wondering why empty is not universe polymorphic

What situation would it be an advantage for empty to be polymorphic?

oh wait, is lean's universe cumulative?

If you need `empty` in universe `u`, you can use `ulift.up.{u} empty`. `ulift` is a tool to fit objects of different universes together.

No, it's not

very nice, thank you.

we use `ulift` when we would need cumulativeness

In general, you should use universe variables as rarely as possible and use `ulift`. When you build definitions like `list`, you have no choice to make it universe polymorphic so that it can be used in various universes: `list : Type u -> Type u`. That's because if `list : Type -> Type`, there's no way of using lift on `a : Type 3` in order to have a `list a`

ahh, can't understand the error
ulift Type 
not match 
Type u

Can you show the code?

#### [Zesen Qian (Jul 05 2018 at 21:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/universe polymorphic version of empty?/near/129159295):
```
def clause : list (Type u) â†’ Type u
| ([]) := ulift.up.{u+1} empty
| (x :: xs) := sum x $ clause xs
```

Use `ulift empty` instead of `ulift.up empty`. `ulift.up` is something you use on a term. On a type, you use simply `ulift`
