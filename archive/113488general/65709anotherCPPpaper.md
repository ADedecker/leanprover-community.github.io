Hi all, I wanted to share my own submission in CPP this year, which just made it on arXiv: [Formalizing computability theory via partial recursive functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08380)

I've never shared papers on arXiv. Do publishers ever object to it?

I don't know about CS, but in physics and math (so far as I know) such objections would be extremely unusual. Journals might restrict sharing the final published / peer-reviewed versions, but I've not had to deal with anything too onerous (I think for one paper the journal didn't want us toupload the revised version to the arxiv until a few months after the paper was published).

I've put all the papers I've ever published on arXiv

I'm not a fan of paywalls generally

I've never received any indication that it is objectionable, and most journals explicitly say it's okay

Oh, that's interesting. I think I'm going to start doing that.

I just had a look at the paper, @**Mario Carneiro**, I really like the type setting. It both looks like code and like math. Nice!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 06:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244525):
I really like the conference style file :)

hm, I just noticed the latex rendering for arxiv has a few overrun problems. Ignore that - I'm sure they will go away in the $30 version or w/e

I guess the "PL’18, January 01–03, 2018, New York, NY, USA" everywhere is also just part of the template

In maths we are getting more and more diamond open access journals: no paywall for the reader, no paywall for the author. That's the way it ought to be.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Oct 22 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244975):
Also: congrats with the paper! (@**Simon Hudon** One telltale sign about the typesetting: maths-maths papers are never set in 2 columns.)

yes Bryan, the conference is supposed to supply the appropriate template during preparation
