<p>Hi all, I wanted to share my own submission in CPP this year, which just made it on arXiv: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08380" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08380">Formalizing computability theory via partial recursive functions</a></p>

<p>I've never shared papers on arXiv. Do publishers ever object to it?</p>

<p>I don't know about CS, but in physics and math (so far as I know) such objections would be extremely unusual. Journals might restrict sharing the final published / peer-reviewed versions, but I've not had to deal with anything too onerous (I think for one paper the journal didn't want us toupload the revised version to the arxiv until a few months after the paper was published).</p>

<p>I've put all the papers I've ever published on arXiv</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of paywalls generally</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 06:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244111):
<p>I've never received any indication that it is objectionable, and most journals explicitly say it's okay</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Oct 22 2018 at 06:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244168):
<p>Oh, that's interesting. I think I'm going to start doing that.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Oct 22 2018 at 06:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244524):
<p>I just had a look at the paper, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, I really like the type setting. It both looks like code and like math. Nice!</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 06:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244525):
<p>I really like the conference style file :)</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 06:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244627):
<p>hm, I just noticed the latex rendering for arxiv has a few overrun problems. Ignore that - I'm sure they will go away in the $30 version or w/e</p>

#### [ Bryan Gin-ge Chen (Oct 22 2018 at 06:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244653):
<p>I guess the "PL’18, January 01–03, 2018, New York, NY, USA" everywhere is also just part of the template</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 22 2018 at 06:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244918):
<p>In maths we are getting more and more diamond open access journals: no paywall for the reader, no paywall for the author. That's the way it ought to be.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 22 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136244975):
<p>Also: congrats with the paper! (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> One telltale sign about the typesetting: maths-maths papers are never set in 2 columns.)</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/another%20CPP%20paper/near/136245108):
<p>yes Bryan, the conference is supposed to supply the appropriate template during preparation</p>
