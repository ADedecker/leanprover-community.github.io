<p>What do these do? I can't understand anything :-(</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jul 27 2018 at 12:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Simon%27s%20%22traversable%22%20PR%27s./near/130402632):
<p>You can have a look at <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type.20class.20traversable" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type.20class.20traversable">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type.20class.20traversable</a> but I fear this really CS and software engineering.</p>

<p>I was also planning to ask after Simon will be done with his series of PR</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 27 2018 at 12:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Simon%27s%20%22traversable%22%20PR%27s./near/130402721):
<p>Oh so it's nothing to do with the "transportable" proving that if X is a perfectoid space and X equiv Y then Y is a perfectoid space?</p>

<p>I think Simon mentioned a link at some point</p>

<p>It's very much CS, though I wouldn't call it software engineering. If you're interested in references, see:<br>

<p>I believe Simon is setting up infrastructure to simplify expression manipulation and, therefore, tactic writing.</p>

<p>Aah thanks!</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 27 2018 at 14:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Simon%27s%20%22traversable%22%20PR%27s./near/130405496):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span> that's pretty much it. Plus, I think Lean should be like Haskell as a programming language and traversable should help with that.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Don't despair, <code>transportable</code> is still under development.</p>

<p>... and so is <code>mono</code>, if people still remember it</p>
