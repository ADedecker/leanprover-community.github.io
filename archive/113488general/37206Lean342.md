I kind of forgot about it, and so did everyone else, I guess. Still, how about a Lean patch release in time for Lean Together? It looks like most discussions are back to complaining about general issues instead of specific bugs.

is this adding anything new or is it just the fixes that are already on master?

It looks like at least PR lean#1982 and lean#1983 wouldn't be hard to merge though

I see `coinductive` is still registered as a built-in token, oops

`coinductive` is a token in C++, but I think that was there even before the `coinductive_predicates` file

it shouldn't be any harm to have it as an undefined token

I think we should keep the token though. We'll make use of it in mathlib

From comparing the macOS build logs [here (failing)](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/lean/jobs/477775262#L1091) and [here (working)](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/lean/jobs/467292242#L1890), it seems that the issue is that rvm [added a new maintainer](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/4520) so that the old GPG key doesn't work anymore.

Can we turn the `[ ... ]` notation for list into a type class `has_bracket`?

Lie algebras have a binary operation denoted `[x,y]` and it is very common to write `[n]` for `fin (n+1)`.

At some point, `::` was overloaded to also mean `vector.cons`. Everybody who just wanted to use lists hated the ambiguity issues and so it was removed. I don't think overloading `[...]` (or making it a class) would fare any better.

So now there are 29 people who "just want to use lists" and 29 people who don't care about lists at all, and want to use `[...]` for other things. (Ooh, and there is 1 logician.)

Thanks so much for this Sebastian. As you have seen last week, there are more and more people working with Lean 3, both in mathematics and computer science, and even though we have clearly heard Leo's message that Lean 4 makes no guarantees of compatibility with Lean 3, I am sure that the growing user base and code base will ultimately teach you developers something about how Lean is used in the wild and in particular where it performs well and where it performs less well. You are an invaluable bridge between us and Leo at this time.

`leanpkg.toml` in `mathlib` is still specifying 3.4.1 so it will override the system default. The current master of mathlib also isn't compatible with 3.4.2 yet.

If I understand `elan` correctly, the upgrade should be transparent, once `mathlib` has merged (one of) those PRs.

Oh, that makes sense. So if the `leanpkg.toml` file states it uses version `3.4.2`, then that version of Lean would also be automatically downloaded when running `leanpkg build`? That's neat!

still some build issue in the PR

To all who are anxious to see this merged: Please make sure the PR *actually builds* before asking me to hurry up on merging it. I have other obligations with school right now, so I don't have a lot of time to devote to troubleshooting here

Sorry, I'd thought that the problem was a Travis cache issue. I'm taking a look at it now.

OK, I think the issue is that there's a `constant foo` in `tests/finish1.lean` and this conflicts with the `coinductive foo` in `tests/coinductive.lean`. I've renamed the latter `foo` to `coind_foo` and it works now. Pushing...

the `foo` thing is a bit weird. @**Gabriel Ebner** You might know what's happening here - are all the tests executing in the same environment?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Jan 21 2019 at 11:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%203.4.2/near/156525675):
No, the tests are not run in the same environment.  But we then we export all files [into the plain-text format for leanchecker](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/c1e594bc3dfb6c9357e94196cc3ae5d435bb07f1/.travis.yml#L40).  This ensures that there are no clashes in the top-level declaration names, and that you can actually import all of mathlib together.
That said, now everything is in `src/`, we could easily exclude the tests here: just change that line to `lean --recursive --export=mathlib.txt src/`

@**Mario Carneiro** The 3.4.1 branch woes of mathlib should now be over, right? All you need to do is to point the branch at a random recent commit which worked with 3.4.1 and then never think about it again -- future mathlib commits are not guaranteed to work with 3.4.1 from now on.

```quote

```
For future reference, note that a stronger statement is true. mathlib is now guaranteed not to work with Lean 3.4.1. The reason is that some stuff moved from core library to mathlib. Hence trying to compile mathlib with Lean 3.4.1 will result in errors complaining some stuff is already defined.

Should we have a lean-3.4.1 tag for mathlib for those determined not to upgrade to Lean 3.4.2?

Aah! Is this `logic.relator` or something? I just had this because I download elan finally but still had 3.4.1 hard coded in VS code.
