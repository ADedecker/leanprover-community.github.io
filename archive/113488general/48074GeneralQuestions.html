<p>Hi people. I'm new to Lean Therom Prover and have a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Has this software got the potential to prove all known mathematics? </li>
<li>Has the software ever proved a mathematical theorem to be incorrect? </li>
<li>Is there potential for Artificial Intelligence type software to hypothesize theorems and prove them correct or incorrect using this software to find new mathematical knowledge?</li>
<li>Is this software something a computer scientist with high-school level mathematics skills could contribute towards?</li>
<li>Is there a database of Theorems proven by this software?</li>
<li>Can a (new) theorem use other theorems as dependencies? </li>
<li>Are there mathematical theorems that can't be written in this software yet? How would the software be changed so they can?</li>
<li>What are the limits of this software?</li>
<li>Are there any beginner video guides on using this software? (on Youtube or learning platform such as Udemy etc)</li>
<li>Has the software been used to prove anything new? (previously unproven)</li>
<li>Are there some simple proofs that even a beginner could understand?</li>
</ol>
