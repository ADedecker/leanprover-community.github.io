Recently Johannes wrote `rwa [htop] {occs := occurrences.pos [2]}` and I suddenly became aware of the rewrite tactic configuration options. Is it only me who missed this? I don't see anything about this in TPIL or the reference manual. I searched a bit and found: https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/rewrite_tactic.lean#L11 and https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/occurrences.lean. So in case some terms appear several times, you can tell `rw` where you want to rewrite: everywhere (this is the default), only at a list of positions, everywhere except at a list of positions. There are two other parameters. `symm` presumably has to do with backward rewriting. Does it mean everything backward? Or try backward if forward doesn't work? We can experiment if nobody knows. And the last parameter is `md` which seem related to reducibility stuff.

Previously I was using `conv` whenever I should have been using the `occs` parameter

I'm still learning basic lean atm, and I've come across this recently: https://leanprover.github.io/tutorial/tutorial.pdf
This is an outdated Theorem Proving in Lean pdf for lean 2. However, there is an appendix in this version, which doesn't exist in the newer version.

Even though quite a lot of the tactics have been renamed, changed, or removed, it's still pretty useful as a quick reference, especially for new learners like me. Should someone who's more familiar and knowledgeable about lean tactics update the appendix?

Good question! @**Jeremy Avigad** what happened to this appendix?

Tactics in Lean 2 worked completely different from Lean 3 tactics. Also the syntax very much changes. So I guess the appendix needed to be scrapped :(

I think the closest thing is the reference manual. https://leanprover.github.io/reference/lean_reference.pdf

This may not be completely up to date, and doesn't cover the mathlib-specific tactics.

But it's certainly more accurate than the Lean 2 tutorial.

It's also worth mentioning the more informal docs on e.g. `simp` and `cc` at https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/tree/master/docs/extras

Yes, documentation for tactics in the core lib is in the reference manual, which should match the docstrings closely. The documentation for the mathlib tactics is also really helpful: https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/tactics.md

The `occs` parameter for `rewrite` is a bit unreliable (or at least its behaviour is somewhat unintuitive).
