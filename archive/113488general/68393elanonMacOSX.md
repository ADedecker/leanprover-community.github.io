<p>I'm giving another try for elan and here is what happens when I install <code>nightly</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ elan toolchain install nightly
info: syncing channel updates for &#39;nightly&#39;
error: failed to resolve latest version of &#39;nightly&#39;
info: caused by: failed to parse latest release tag
</pre></div>

<p>Is this because of OSX or because of the latest nightly?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> Oops... should be fixed in 0.3.4</p>

<p>Well, elan doesn't like your antivirus either</p>

<p>Like, there is literally nothing I can do :) . You could try to send them the executable as a false positive and tell them to get their act together.</p>
