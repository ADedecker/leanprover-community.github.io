<p>I made my first attempt at a PR today <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/934" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/934">934</a> and got a build error that seems spurious.  I see that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> has made another PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/936" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/936">936</a> which changes the build testing process, presumably to fix this problem.  The root cause seems to be that I read the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/howto-contribute.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/howto-contribute.md">how to contribute</a> page and the linked page on <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/" target="_blank" title="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/">fork-and-branch workflow</a>, and following those instructions, made my changes in a new fork of mathlib at <a href="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib</a>.  But I see that none of the other open PRs are doing that, they just come from branches of leanprover-community/mathlib.  Are those instructions considered to be outdated?  If so, is there anything newer?  Would I need permissions to work with branches of leanprover-community/mathlib?</p>
