I was really surprised by the following `simp` behavior. There is a lemma in `ennreal` that reads
```lean
@[simp] lemma sub_eq_zero_of_le (h : a ≤ b) : a - b = 0
```
It can be improved to
```lean
@[simp] lemma sub_eq_zero_iff_le : a - b = 0 ↔ a ≤ b
```
(following the general rule: if there is an equivalence, don't state the implication). From what I understand of the simplifier, the second version should be strictly stronger than the first. For the first one, if there is a goal `a - b = 0`, the simplifier checks if it knows that `a ≤ b` and if yes it closes the goal. For the second one, if there is a goal `a - b = 0`, then it is reduced to `a ≤ b`. Then if this fact is known to the simplifier it will reduce to `true` and will be closed.
It turns out I am wrong: if I remove the first lemma and add the second instead, then some proofs break. I would like to understand why, and what it means on the way we should state simp lemmas.

Having the second one as a rewrite lemma means that if `a - b = 0` appears in the statement, then it can be replaced by `a <= b`. Having the first means that if simp can prove `a <= b` then it can replace `a - b` in the goal with `0`. That means that things like `(a - b) + b = b` will simplify as well, where the iff version won't trigger

generally speaking it is important to view a simp lemma as `conditions -> LHS => RHS`, and modifications like this change the structure of the rewrite

it might be that you want to rewrite `a - b = 0` to `a <= b` but that's a different rule

Yes, of course. I was thinking of the lemma `lemma foo (h : a ≤ b) : (a - b = 0) ↔ true`, but this is a different rewrite rule.
