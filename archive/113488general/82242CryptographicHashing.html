<p>Axiom will include proofs (presumably validated by Lean) for its algorithms. Ideally, when a computation is requested from Lean for a GCD, the result as well as a GCD algorithm proof is returned. Lean can then verify that the proof is valid. But it is computationally more efficient if both Axiom and Lean use a cryptographic hash, such as SHA1. That way the proof doesn't need to be 'reproven', only the hash computation over the proof text needs to be performed. Hashes are blazingly fast. This allows proofs to be exchanged without the need to re-run the proof mechanism. Since a large computation request from Lean might involve many algorithms there would be considerable overhead to recompute each proof. A hash simplifies the issue yet provides proof integrity.</p>

<p>Reid was once telling me about some theoretical elliptic curve cryptographic hash mechanism for proofs.  I’m having trouble remembering the main idea, much less the details. But in you case, is the idea that Axiom (or Lean) would store the hashes of previously checked proofs, so if a hash is in the list of checked hashes, it could safely avoid checking it again?  Why hash the proof?  Couldn’t you store (or hash) the theorem statement itself?  Maybe I am misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I think you want the notion of a probabilistically checkable proof?</p>
