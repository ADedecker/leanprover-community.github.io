The interval [0,infty] is quite special: you can add countably many things together. Does Lean know this fact? What is this structure called in general?

What's your motivation? (I know, it's an evil question. But I think it doesn't hurt to have a bit of focus.)

you can add infinitely many things, even

the property is shared with canonically ordered semirings with a top element

that are also totally ordered complete lattices

`enat` is also such a thing

@**Johan Commelin** measure theory, of course :D

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 30 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148858784):
it's possible that [0, infty] is unique if you add a few more conditions

like nonatomicity

To add infinitely many things together, I don't think you need `semiring`, `add_monoid` should suffice. So you want some `linearly_ordered_add_monoid_with_top`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 30 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148858914):
the complete lattice part is important, and it gives the top

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 30 2018 at 13:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148858930):
in a complete lattice where every element is nonnegative, you can define arbitrary sums as a supremum of finite subsums

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Nov 30 2018 at 13:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148858935):
@**Kenny Lau** are you looking for `ennreal.has_sum` ( https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/analysis/ennreal.lean#L308 ) It says that at the `ennreal`s every infinite familiy has a well defined sum

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 30 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148858999):
nice

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 30 2018 at 13:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148859458):
well if A is partially ordered and f:A->B->[0,infty] is a homomorphism for each b, then sup[a] sum[b] f(a,b) = sum[b] sup[a] f(a,b) right

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Nov 30 2018 at 14:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148859649):
I think you need some directedness or monotonicity assumption of `f`, look at `ennreal.supr_add_supr` ( https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/2a86b06b1853493ab4fb381514e7d1a3f4dfc54b/analysis/ennreal.lean#L198  )

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Nov 30 2018 at 14:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148859855):
to generalize this to an arbitrary function `f : A -> B -> ennreal` you might combine `tsum_eq_supr_sum` and `finset_sum_supr_nat` (which btw has the wrong name, the `nat` needs to be removed)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 30 2018 at 14:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148859868):
I did say homomorphism

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Nov 30 2018 at 14:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148860004):
So you meant with **homomorphisms** functions which are directed or monotone?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Nov 30 2018 at 14:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148860043):
this should work for `ennreal`, and surely for some kind of canoncially ordered monoids on a complete lattice

Ah, there are subsets of [0,infty] with this property that are not isomorphic to enat: the set of elements a/2^n where n,a : nat and 3^n <= a, plus infty

that a1 <= a2 implies f(a1,b) <= f(a2,b)

you mean n : int?

no, but it doesn't matter

what is a+a?

oh you don’t fix a

yeah it's a kind of weird set. it gets denser as you go up

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 30 2018 at 14:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148860334):
but it's discrete except at infty

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 30 2018 at 15:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%5B0%2Cinfty%5D/near/148865420):
Suppose X is a topological add comm monoid where every sum converges. First, suppose that a + b = 0. Then the infinite sum a + b + a + b + ... converges to a and also to 0, so if we assume X is Hausdorff then a = 0 (and b = 0). Thus we can define an order by a <= b iff \ex c, a + c = b, and this order is reflexive and transitive (it's divisibility) and a <= 0 -> a = 0.

Similarly, if `a <= b` and `b <= a`, then given `a + c = b` and `b + d = a`, `a + c + d + c + d + ...` converges to both `a` and `b`, so `a = b`. Thus the order is a partial order. There is also a top element `T = \sum a : X, a`. Thus it is an ordered monoid, except that cancellation fails. Assuming X is nonzero, T is non-cancellative, since T + 0 = T + T but T =/= 0. The non-cancellative elements are upward closed.

There are plenty of examples of where this is not a total order, such as the one I gave above (which starts 0, 1, 3/2, and so 1 and 3/2 are incomparable). So let us assume it is. Then the countable suprema can be expressed as sums / limits of finite sub-sums: If `a n` is an increasing sequence and `a n + b n = a (n+1)`, then `a 0 + sum n, b n` is the sup of the `a n`.

Let N(a) be the sum of countably many copies of a. This is also the sum of any infinite family of copies of a, because it's still just the limit of n*a for n : nat. This always produces an idempotent, and `b <= N(a)` implies `N(a) + b = N(a)`. If a set `S` satisfies the property that for every `a \in S`, there is `b \in S` with `N(a) <= b`, then the supremum of S is just the sum of the members of S. If not, say `a \in S` has the property that `b < N(a)` for all b in S, then either `N(a)` is the supremum of S, or for some n `n*a` is not an upper bound and `n*a + a` is. So we add n copies of a and then iterate to find the supremum of `{b | n*a + b \in S}`. The iteration is by transfinite induction using a well ordering of X, since we never pick the same element twice since they are decreasing in the natural order. The result is a supremum for the whole set S.

Thus X is a complete lattice. But now I'm out of time, characterization coming soon...
