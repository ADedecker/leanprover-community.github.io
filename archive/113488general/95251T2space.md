Why isn't T2 space a `Prop`?

it should be

I think the current definition is wrong:
```lean
class t2_space (α : Type u) [topological_space α] : Prop :=
(t2 : ∀x y, x ≠ y → ∃u v : set α, is_open u ∧ is_open v ∧ x ∈ u ∧ y ∈ v ∧ u ∩ v = ∅)
```
I think the right one should be:
```lean
class t2_space (α : Type u) [topological_space α] : Prop :=
(t2 : ∀x y, (∀u v : set α, is_open u → is_open v → x ∈ u → y ∈ v → ∃ r, r ∈ u ∩ v) → x = y)
```

Aren't they the same?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 29 2018 at 11:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136698230):
Blind guess: they are not constructively the same

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 29 2018 at 11:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136698277):
Now I'll read the two definitions

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 29 2018 at 11:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136698384):
My vote: keep the current definition

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Oct 29 2018 at 14:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136704564):
Presumably one of them implies the other constructively? Maybe the weaker one should be T1.9999999..., which presumably is not constructively equal to 2.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Oct 29 2018 at 14:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136704733):
More seriously, even though this definition is in a file with `local attribute [instance] prop_decidable` right at the top, maybe there is a case for calling one of them `t2_space'` or something?

#### [ Reid Barton (Oct 29 2018 at 14:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136706638):
I think it's usually better to have a theorem `t2_iff_kenny`, rather than two equivalent definitions

#### [ Reid Barton (Oct 29 2018 at 15:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/T2%20space/near/136707625):
that is, assuming the purpose is that the `kenny` characterization is easier to work with for some purposes
