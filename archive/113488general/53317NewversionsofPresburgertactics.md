#### [ Seul Baek (Oct 30 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/New%20versions%20of%20Presburger%20tactics/near/136761498):
<p>This project has been neglected for a long time, so I decided to tidy it up a bit. The new versions are available at <a href="https://github.com/skbaek/qe/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/skbaek/qe/">https://github.com/skbaek/qe/</a>. The main changes are :</p>
<p>1. Now there are tactics for <code>nat</code>, although they are slower than <code>int</code> equivalents due to quantifiers added during translation<br>
2. There are versions that use <code>znum</code> instead of <code>int</code> in the shadow syntax for optimization<br>
3. Makes more use of typeclasses<br>
4. Also includes a tactic for DLO without endpoints for <code>rat</code><br>
5. The <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file is fixed, so you can install it using <code>leanpkg</code></p>
<p>The main tactics are in the <code>main.lean</code> files of each directory. You can see the <code>tests.lean</code> files for examples of how they are used. As you might expect, <code>znum</code> is more efficient when handling large numbers, so there are examples which time out for <code>int</code>-based tactics but works with <code>znum</code>.</p>
<p>3 and 4 were done just to show that the shared-framework approach is viable. The idea (from <a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf">Tobias Nipkow</a>) is that QE-based FoL decision procedures mostly follow the same scheme, so the common part should be factored out using some module or typeclass system. Once this work is done, it is easy to cook up more decision procedures, since all you need to do is define (and prove soundness for) a single quantifier elimination step.</p>

<p>Thanks! Could you include a glossary of what all those acronyms mean? Maybe in a README.md?</p>

<p>What are all those commented out lines in the test files? Things that should work but don't?</p>

<p>For the purpose of using tests as documentation, it would probably be more efficient to move those test files somewhere more visible</p>

<p>Yes, I should either do that, or actually give intelligible names to definitions, which I was too lazy to type out when doing the proofs.</p>

<p>The commented out lines are either theorems which currently time out, or nontheorems which would be useful for testing the soundness of unverified vm-versions of the tactics (which currently don't exist, but are easy to implement if necessary).</p>

#### [ Seul Baek (Oct 30 2018 at 10:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/New%20versions%20of%20Presburger%20tactics/near/136764898):
<p>Do you mean that it would be useful to add some introductory information about the tactics for users, and include tests as part of it? So far I've been using the tests just to check that it works, but I guess you're right that this would be more helpful as documentation.</p>

<p>Maybe call them "examples" instead of "tests," if they're being used as documentation. But yeah, this would be super helpful!</p>

<p>How much of mathlib does this depend on?</p>

<p>This looks great, by the way, I'm excited to try it out.</p>

#### [ Seul Baek (Oct 30 2018 at 11:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/New%20versions%20of%20Presburger%20tactics/near/136767194):
<p>It depends mainly on the <code>int</code> and <code>nat</code> libraries, along with some inequality stuff from algebraic libraries. At one point I needed some gcd lemmas not included in the master branch, so the current .toml file is tweaked to get 3.4.1 instead. But when I look for it now I can't pinpoint that incompatibility, so perhaps it works with master now.</p>
