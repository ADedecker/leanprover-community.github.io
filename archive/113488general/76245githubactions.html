<p>We have recently switched to github actions instead of Travis. Now, even on my fork, all branches get built. If I understand correctly, this is because the file <code>build.yml</code> got copied when I updated master.</p>
<p>I often push work in progress to github, to save it. Now, github tries to build this work in progress, which a crazy waste of processor time. Moreover, it tries to build it both on 3.4.2 and nightlies, which is a double waste. I tried to use commit messages with <code>[ci skip]</code>, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Do you see a way I could improve my workflow?</p>

<p>If you don't want your branches to be built, you can disable github actions (for your repository) at <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/settings/actions" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/settings/actions">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/settings/actions</a></p>

<p>I can't comment on the "waste of resources" part.  The mathlib build only takes a fraction of the time limit set by github, they clearly seem to expect this usage.  Are there any downsides to building mathlib with multiple lean versions?  Do you get inundated with emails?</p>
