<p>I want to be able to step through the type checker on a proof the same way I could step through the execution of a program in a debugger. When reading a proof on paper, there is uncertainty about what exactly is going on and the meaning of symbols. In principle, the benefit of computer proofs is that this ambiguity goes away. I've been trying to understand the proofs in mathlib. For instance, the proof that sqrt(2) is irrational, and the proof that the reals are uncountable. I have VSCode setup with lean, and see the goal outputs and types when I put my cursor at places in these proofs. I'm finding that I'm still largely guessing at what each line is doing. In the end it seems no different than reading a proof on paper. I'm wondering if Lean provides any additional debugger tools that let me step through every single step the type checker goes through?</p>

<p>Perhaps <code>#explode</code> might help break the proof down a bit more</p>

<p>If proofs are written in tactic mode then it's easy to step through them. If they're in term mode, or in tactic mode but with semicolon separators, then it's harder but you can often find out more by deleting terms and replacing them with a <code>_</code>, which can sometimes persuade lean to tell you the type of the term which is supposed to go in the hole.</p>

<p>My understanding of the question is that he is not happy with the level of detail provided by tactic proofs</p>
