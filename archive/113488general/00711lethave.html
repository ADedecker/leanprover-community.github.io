<p>I am writing instructional materials for mathematicians and I am beginning to feel that it's more and more ridiculous that I have to distinguish between <code>let</code> and <code>have</code>. There are plenty of examples of proposition/data fails in this chat, and sometimes they even make it into mathlib. "Why does this give me an obscure message about the VM?". "Because you used <code>have</code> not <code>let</code>". "Why does this not work?" "Because you are a mathematician and you make that statement a lemma because that's what your tribe call it, but of course it should be a definition". </p>
<p>Why can't we have <em>one</em> tactic which chooses whether or not to keep track of the term based on a sensible algorithm which works 99% of the time? It would be easier to teach to mathematicians. Computer scientists have opinions about proof irrelevance. Mathematicians <em>have no understanding of the question</em>. In fact I would go so far as to say that proper mathematicians think that proof irrelevance is irrelevant. We don't care whether two different proofs are the same, we are not philosophers. </p>
<p>I am playing with the way mathematicians think in the natural number game. I've got some preliminary world 5 up at</p>

<p>where mathematicians learn <code>exact</code>, <code>apply</code> etc in the context of functions, and now I am writing world 6 (Proposition world) and the joke that it is <em>exactly the same as world 5</em> except that all the Types change to Props. Except that I have to change all the <code>let</code>s to <code>have</code>s and I have not dealt with proof impredicativity yet (and to be quite frank it's very low on my list, I believe we can teach mathematicians to use Lean to construct basic proofs without ever worrying about these foundational philosophical questions). <br>
The more I type this the more I am thinking "actually why don't I just tell them to use <code>let</code>?". But I would rather tell them to use a modded <code>let</code> which does the right thing and doesn't complicate my local context with <code>hq : Q := hpq hp</code>. Is there an argument for such a tactic, which runs <code>have</code> or <code>let</code> depending on what it's building?</p>

<p>Yes! And let's call it <code>have</code>.</p>

<p>I don't mind which one we call it.</p>

<p>I mean there's <code>#lint</code> which detects when a def/lemma is tagged wrong so there should be such a tactic</p>
