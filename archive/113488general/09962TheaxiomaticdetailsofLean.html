<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for how I might go about studying the axiomatic details of Lean? I'm aware of the main.pdf at <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases">https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases</a> but.. what is the large arrangement of weird looking symbols in section 2 supposed to mean? Also, the paper says that type checking in Lean is undecidable. Does this mean that Lean might not be able to check some proofs?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> is the author of that pdf. He also happens to be superhuman, so he'll probably be right over... :)</p>
