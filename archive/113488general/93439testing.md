@**Kevin Buzzard** do you get a ping?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 31 2018 at 23:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/testing/near/136886636):
I didn't notice -- I was online and I just saw a new message appear in testing

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 31 2018 at 23:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/testing/near/136886639):
@**Kevin Buzzard** do you get a ping (i.e. do you see this message in "Mentions")?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 31 2018 at 23:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/testing/near/136886756):
Is the point that you write a message without mentioning me and then edit it so it mentions me?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Oct 31 2018 at 23:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/testing/near/136886768):
What happened this time was that I saw your message appear, so I don't think this test is conclusive.

give me one minute to go to another stream and then I'll look for Mentions.
