#### [ Reid Barton (Mar 06 2018 at 18:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hiding/near/123359129):
<p>I imported tactic.ring to handle an identity and now as a result I have a lemma <code>pow_two</code> in the root namespace which conflicts with my own lemma <code>pow_two</code>, which I use about a dozen times in various proofs.<br>
Is there a way to hide imported identifiers?</p>
