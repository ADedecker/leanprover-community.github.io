#### [ Reid Barton (Mar 06 2018 at 18:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hiding/near/123359129):
I imported tactic.ring to handle an identity and now as a result I have a lemma `pow_two` in the root namespace which conflicts with my own lemma `pow_two`, which I use about a dozen times in various proofs.
Is there a way to hide imported identifiers?
