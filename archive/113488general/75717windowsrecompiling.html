<p>I recently installed Lean 3.4.2 from binaries on a Windows laptop, but I noticed that whenever I opened a file in VS code, the yellow bars stuck around for a while. On investigating, I came across a problem I have come across before. When I went to the <code>lean-3.4.2-windows</code> folder and typed <code>lean --make</code>, it would compile a bunch of files. If I did it again, it would compile some more. If I typed <code>lean --make</code> yet again, it would go back and recompile the first set, and cycle back and forth.</p>
<p>The only way I could break the cycle was to delete all the <code>.olean</code> files and do a fresh <code>lean --make</code>. After that, subsequent <code>lean --make</code>s were a no-op. </p>
<p>Has anyone else come across this problem? I told my students they could install Lean from the binaries, so I will warn them and ask them to let me know if they see funny behavior with the yellow bars.</p>

<p>Thanks. I know that I can build Lean from source, but I think it is easier for my students to install the binary, even if it means that they should delete all the <code>.olean</code> files and recompile.</p>
