#### [ Jeremy Avigad (Sep 25 2018 at 22:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/slogan/near/134625070):
<p>I am writing from an AFOSR meeting on dynamical systems and control theory in Washington, DC. This morning, one of the speakers, Arthur Krener, used the following slogan:</p>
<p><em>Think mathematically, act computationally.</em></p>
<p>It's a nice play on Buckminster Fuller's famous slogan, and it is widely applicable. It also fits well with this group, so I thought I would pass it along.</p>
