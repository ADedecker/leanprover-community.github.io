<p>What's the easiest way to create the abelian group <code>ℚ/ℤ</code>? I need to choose a way of phrasing <code>x - y ∈ ℤ</code> and prove that it is an equivalence.</p>

<p>Surely there is just a general construction of quotient abelian groups, and then separately a construction of Z as a subgroup of Q.</p>

<p>My student has quotient groups done, but he's been busy / having trouble getting Lean to compile, and so hasn't PRd it.</p>

<p>and before you say quotient module, no, mathlib doesn't know that an add_comm_group is a Z-module</p>

<p>btw, I want to convince you to do less new stuff, because you're busy PR'ing stuff you've already done into mathlib. Development that gets done but not PR'd is essentially wasted (except of course as a learning experience).</p>

<p>No, I can't find stuff in your repo. :-) I need it to be organised properly, and importable via leanpkg without any errors or sorries, and I need the lemmas to be named, and proofs structured, etc., according to style guides, etc. etc., because otherwise it's too hard to use.</p>

<p>Just like there is a huge amount of working getting from "I know how to prove everything" when working on a research project to "The paper is ready to go to the arxiv", I think there's huge value in going through the PR process.</p>

<p>I don't think it's possible. Here's a rough idea why: You are given an element a \in G and want to prove it is zero. The only way is to use the assumption, which involves building a homomorphism to Q/Z. But you have to do so using only a "finite amount of information" from a; in this context that means that you can only calculate its order up to some bound, meaning that if the order of a is p or q for sufficiently large primes p,q then it can't affect the construction. But if the homomorphism sends <code>a</code> to a fraction with denominator n, then it would be incorrect if p &gt; n is the actual order of <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>You should be careful. Mario is just a student, he has homework just like you, and runs this entire operation on the side without pay (unlike Sebastian, who is a post-doc and being paid to make Lean work better). You just said to Scott "you can find my stuff in my repo". What if Mario just said to you "well mathlib is almost working, you can just find it in the repo, try all the branches, one will probably work for you, I am too busy ATM, go and google for how git works to switch branches".</p>

<p>Sebastian is also a PhD student. But his thesis topic is connected to Lean.</p>

<p>CS research is not that well funded I find. In amounts, there might be more people being funded in CS than in math but research budget doesn't include budget for staff like research engineers / technicians to do the stuff that won't get into papers but that really needs to get done.</p>

<p>So typically, that work is delegated to PhD student which can make PhD students unlucky when they're not careful in their choice of advisors. They might get hired to do menial work</p>
