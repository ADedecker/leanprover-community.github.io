What's the easiest way to create the abelian group `ℚ/ℤ`? I need to choose a way of phrasing `x - y ∈ ℤ` and prove that it is an equivalence.

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648111):
ok I did it:
```
namespace Q_div_Z

instance Q_div_Z.setoid : setoid ℚ :=
⟨λ x y, ∃ n : ℤ, x-y = n,
 λ x, ⟨0, by simp⟩,
 λ x y ⟨n, h⟩, ⟨-n, by simp [h.symm]⟩,
 λ x y z ⟨m, hm⟩ ⟨n, hn⟩, ⟨m + n, by simp [hm.symm, hn.symm]⟩⟩

end Q_div_Z

def Q_div_Z : Type :=
quotient Q_div_Z.Q_div_Z.setoid

namespace Q_div_Z

instance : add_comm_group Q_div_Z :=
by refine
{ add := quotient.lift₂ (λ x y, ⟦x + y⟧) (λ a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ h1 h2,
    have h3 : ∃ n : ℤ, a₁ - b₁ = (n:ℚ), from h1,
    have h4 : ∃ n : ℤ, a₂ - b₂ = (n:ℚ), from h2,
    let ⟨m, hm⟩ := h3 in
    let ⟨n, hn⟩ := h4 in
    quotient.sound $ ⟨m + n, by simp [hm.symm, hn.symm]⟩),
  zero := ⟦0⟧,
  neg := quotient.lift (λ x, ⟦-x⟧) (λ a b h,
    have H : ∃ n : ℤ, a - b = (n:ℚ), from h,
    let ⟨n, hn⟩ := H in
    quotient.sound $ ⟨-n, by simp [hn.symm]⟩),
  .. };
{ intros,
  try {apply quotient.induction_on a, intro a},
  try {apply quotient.induction_on b, intro b},
  try {apply quotient.induction_on c, intro c},
  apply quotient.sound, simp }

end Q_div_Z

Surely there is just a general construction of quotient abelian groups, and then separately a construction of Z as a subgroup of Q.

and surely it isn't in mathlib :)

You're smooshing everything together.

My student has quotient groups done, but he's been busy / having trouble getting Lean to compile, and so hasn't PRd it.

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648290):
and before you say quotient module, no, mathlib doesn't know that an add_comm_group is a Z-module

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648295):
and before you say it can be proved easily, no, mathlib doesn't know that (m+n)a = ma+na

although I did prove it in my tensor_product construction

quite a handful of lemmas are missing from algebra/group_power

(What he has done is for quotient groups, not quotients of abelian groups, but that part hopefully isn't too hard.)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 05 2018 at 02:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648301):
Okay, I will see if I can get his work PR'd in soon; perhaps I can even do it this weekend.

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648302):
well one would have to wait until mathlib builds

His work is at <https://github.com/semorrison/2017-summer-students/blob/master/src/mitchell/group_theory/quotient_group.lean> if you're in a hurry.

btw, I want to convince you to do less new stuff, because you're busy PR'ing stuff you've already done into mathlib. Development that gets done but not PR'd is essentially wasted (except of course as a learning experience).

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648450):

Well... what happens to it? It sits on your computer and then bitrots? :-)

This is of course just selfish --- I see you're doing lots of useful stuff, and I want to be able to use it!

I don't see how Q_div_Z is useful to you

and you can still find my stuff in my repo

No, I can't find stuff in your repo. :-) I need it to be organised properly, and importable via leanpkg without any errors or sorries, and I need the lemmas to be named, and proofs structured, etc., according to style guides, etc. etc., because otherwise it's too hard to use.

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 05 2018 at 02:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648518):

Just like there is a huge amount of working getting from "I know how to prove everything" when working on a research project to "The paper is ready to go to the arxiv", I think there's huge value in going through the PR process.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 05 2018 at 02:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124648572):
It's true, having mathlib build, stapled to particular Lean builds, will be wonderful. :-)

I am of course being a hypocrite, failing to get my category theory library ready for a PR fast enough... But I'm trying!

the first function is `f`, the second is `g`, ...

The third one seems pretty uncontroversial.

Does anyone see a constructive proof of $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G, \Bbb Q/\Bbb Z) = 0 \implies G = 0$$?

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 05 2018 at 03:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124650123):
I don't think it's possible. Here's a rough idea why: You are given an element a \in G and want to prove it is zero. The only way is to use the assumption, which involves building a homomorphism to Q/Z. But you have to do so using only a "finite amount of information" from a; in this context that means that you can only calculate its order up to some bound, meaning that if the order of a is p or q for sufficiently large primes p,q then it can't affect the construction. But if the homomorphism sends `a` to a fraction with denominator n, then it would be incorrect if p > n is the actual order of `a`.

You should be careful. Mario is just a student, he has homework just like you, and runs this entire operation on the side without pay (unlike Sebastian, who is a post-doc and being paid to make Lean work better). You just said to Scott "you can find my stuff in my repo". What if Mario just said to you "well mathlib is almost working, you can just find it in the repo, try all the branches, one will probably work for you, I am too busy ATM, go and google for how git works to switch branches".

> unlike Sebastian, who is a post-doc and being paid to make Lean work better

Sebastian is also a PhD student. But his thesis topic is connected to Lean.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 05 2018 at 10:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124661962):

Where are all the people being paid to work on Lean??

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 05 2018 at 16:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124673006):
CS research is not that well funded I find. In amounts, there might be more people being funded in CS than in math but research budget doesn't include budget for staff like research engineers / technicians to do the stuff that won't get into papers but that really needs to get done.

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 05 2018 at 16:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%E2%84%9A/%E2%84%A4/near/124673053):
So typically, that work is delegated to PhD student which can make PhD students unlucky when they're not careful in their choice of advisors. They might get hired to do menial work
