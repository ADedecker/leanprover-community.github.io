<p>Hi! I'm looking at the current version of Lean in the browser. I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there a way to bullet cases like in Coq?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems to not work perfectly in Safari, but it seems to work in Firefox from what I can tell. Can people recommend which browsers work well with Lean? I'm thinking of using it for teaching this semester (in a discrete math course) so I'd like as much information as possible about this to pass on to my students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>
