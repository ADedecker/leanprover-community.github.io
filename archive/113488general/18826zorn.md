<p>The current implementation of zorn is not exactly the most convenient, and require some casing to use (see: all the use cases). The more convenient statement would be "a <strong>nonempty</strong> type such that every <strong>nonempty</strong> chain has an upper bound has a maximal element. Also, zorn.chain is for strict orders, which wouldn't be the best thing to use for partial orders (<code>zorn.zorn_partial_order</code>) and subsets (<code>zorn.zorn_subset</code>).</p>

<p>I think I have done this already</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761518):
<p>ok the latter problem is solved by <code>zorn.chain.total</code></p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761564):
<p>but where can I find your work?</p>

<p>I can merge that early if you want, or you can just copy it into your branch and it will get merged with mine eventually</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761774):
<p>Alternatively you might want a different interface; I played with a few alternatives but that's the only version I actually ended up using</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761788):
<p>oh</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761858):
<p>also zorn.chain is for strict or non-strict orders</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762168):
<p>yes but it's not convenient to use</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762177):
<p>?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762236):
<p>that's why <code>zorn.chain.total</code> exists right</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762239):
<p>it's a wrapper for if you use <code>zorn.chain</code> on a non-strict order</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762246):
<p>(that's "for if" as in "por si")</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762287):
<p>(that I just googled to translate to "just in case")</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762301):
<p>s/googled to translate/googled which tells me that it translates/</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762302):
<p>I can't English</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762440):
<p>I'm not following. The definition makes sense for both strict and non-strict orders and there are lemmas to give you equivalent forms when you know one or the other</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762452):
<p>yes, so I say that <code>zorn.chain.total</code> solves the problem</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762466):
<p>do you mean <code>total_of_refl</code> by the way? I can't find <code>zorn.chain.total</code></p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762547):
<p>maybe you <code>open</code>ed zorn</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762549):
<p>in which case it's <code>chain.total</code></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762551):
<p><code>_of_refl</code></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762555):
<p>actually I find <code>chain.directed</code> to be the most useful one; it is rare to actually need a chain as opposed to a directed set in zorn constructions</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762600):

<p>oh, I guess that's just specializing to <code>le</code></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762640):
<p>That shouldn't be necessary (now?) since the <code>&lt;le_refl&gt;</code> part should be derivable by tc inference</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762689):
<p>it's shorter</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762695):
<p>also that's the first one I noticed</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762701):
<p>well if I deleted it the other one would lose the <code>of_refl</code> part</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 30 2018 at 10:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136763363):

<p>Oh! Mario resumed work on modules! Is there hope to have modules before the Freiburg meeting next week? I see lots of underscores in that latest commit though <span class="emoji emoji-2639" title="sad">:sad:</span></p>

<p>Hurray! We are cheering for you Mario!</p>
