The current implementation of zorn is not exactly the most convenient, and require some casing to use (see: all the use cases). The more convenient statement would be "a **nonempty** type such that every **nonempty** chain has an upper bound has a maximal element. Also, zorn.chain is for strict orders, which wouldn't be the best thing to use for partial orders (`zorn.zorn_partial_order`) and subsets (`zorn.zorn_subset`).

@**Mario Carneiro** I'll create a PR if you approve

I think I have done this already

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761518):
ok the latter problem is solved by `zorn.chain.total`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761564):
but where can I find your work?

https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/module/order/zorn.lean#L244-L258

I can merge that early if you want, or you can just copy it into your branch and it will get merged with mine eventually

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761774):
Alternatively you might want a different interface; I played with a few alternatives but that's the only version I actually ended up using

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761788):
oh

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136761858):
also zorn.chain is for strict or non-strict orders

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762168):
yes but it's not convenient to use

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762177):
?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762236):
that's why `zorn.chain.total` exists right

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762239):
it's a wrapper for if you use `zorn.chain` on a non-strict order

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762246):
(that's "for if" as in "por si")

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762287):
(that I just googled to translate to "just in case")

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762301):
s/googled to translate/googled which tells me that it translates/

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762302):
I can't English

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762440):
I'm not following. The definition makes sense for both strict and non-strict orders and there are lemmas to give you equivalent forms when you know one or the other

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762452):
yes, so I say that `zorn.chain.total` solves the problem

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762466):
do you mean `total_of_refl` by the way? I can't find `zorn.chain.total`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762547):
maybe you `open`ed zorn

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762549):
in which case it's `chain.total`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762551):
`_of_refl`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762555):
actually I find `chain.directed` to be the most useful one; it is rare to actually need a chain as opposed to a directed set in zorn constructions

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762600):
[`chain.total`](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/order/zorn.lean#L240)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762628):
oh, I guess that's just specializing to `le`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762640):
That shouldn't be necessary (now?) since the `<le_refl>` part should be derivable by tc inference

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762689):
it's shorter

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762695):
also that's the first one I noticed

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 30 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zorn/near/136762701):
well if I deleted it the other one would lose the `of_refl` part

Oh! Mario resumed work on modules! Is there hope to have modules before the Freiburg meeting next week? I see lots of underscores in that latest commit though :sad:

Hurray! We are cheering for you Mario!
