Is this good? I would assume that `data/fintype.lean` is pretty basic. Is it ok that this imports `algebra.big_operators`?

I think we should move the content of `big_operators` to `finset` anyway. The big operators on lists are in `data/list/...` and the one for `multiset` are in `data/multiset.lean`
