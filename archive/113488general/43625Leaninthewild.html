<p>Its always interesting to find unexpected Lean theories: <a href="https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/">https://github.com/levjj/esverify-theory/</a><br>
From a first glance, <code>esverify</code> is a Javascript/ECMAScript verifier, and these are some semantics with soundness...</p>

<p>A slightly unusual "Lean in the wild" story:</p>
<p>My partner was out at an aerials (circus stuff) class this evening, talking to someone, who at some point in the conversation asked "Coq or Lean"? (Context: they worked in CS at a research institute here in Canberra, my partner mentioned to them I was interested in automated theorem proving.)</p>

<p>I gave a talk in Cambridge two weeks ago and at the end of it Larry Paulson told one of his post-docs to go away and define a scheme in Isabelle, to prove it could be done. When he'd left I told the post-doc that I'd met people who were skeptical.</p>

<p>An example of a dependent type is a function which Johan will have seen, which takes a topological space and presheaf on it, and defines a function from the space sending a point to an element of the stalk of the presheaf at that point.</p>

<p>Can you do that in Isabelle? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> I've noticed that people do non-trivial analysis in this Isabelle thing. So what about schemes? Everyone seems to think it will be hell, apart from Larry.</p>

<p>it's not pleasant to encode a function as a set when the foundation supports functions directly, but it can be done</p>

<p>and it has to be done this way when you can't find a suitable hack to make your dependent type less dependent</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know enough about schemes to know how to write them down in HOL. You essentially need to relativize everything, i.e. make every definition relative to a set. As far as I understand it, for schemes the biggest advantage of dependent types is that we can ad hoc use the subtype of a open set. This is not possible in HOL.</p>

<p>I understand from the "pitch to journalists" standpoint the 'crisis' story is great, and I fully appreciate that the mathematics literature is crap. Nevertheless, I think when talking to other mathematicians, I'd prefer to emphasise more the "this is fun" / "this isn't quite helpful yet, but if you pitch in someday soon this is going to be an awesome tool" / "if you don't pay attention now you're going to be a dinosaur" arguments.</p>

<p>"A case in point was Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem. Only a handful of experts were qualified to evaluate the dense, 200-page proof when it first appeared. "</p>
<p>This is extremely misleading. I'm not even sure that it is true, but even if it is true, within a year or two of the proof appearing there was a very detailed survey article by Darmon, Diamond and Taylor explaining the proof which needed only the kind of background which a graduate student working in this area in algebraic number theory would have, so hundreds and maybe even thousands of people were able to verify the proof within a couple of years of it appearing.</p>

<p>I could give a far harsher talk where I point out various serious mistakes by prestigious people and then point to various recent extremely technical papers by these same people which I know because of insider information did not go through as rigorous a refereeing process as they should have done and then flat out accuse the mathematical community of not having done its job correctly. I am not sure who is the crackpot but recent events in number theory have made me start to firmly believe that it's not me but them. I have thus far refrained from telling such stories in public, but believe you me this is why I am here in the formal proof verification community.</p>
