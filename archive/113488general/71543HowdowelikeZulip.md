I must say that the linear conversation of Gitter is easier to follow. This interleaving of streams and topics: having to figure out where the conversation flows and which topic to post to is a bit of a cognitive load for casual chat.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030150):
Perhaps I'm expecting a chat service when maybe I should be expecting a message board.

I completely agree, this is just a dash too much perusing and clicking around and such.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Feb 27 2018 at 07:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030310):
That's too bad. I really like this one. I especially like that it makes it easier to join a conversation after it ran for a while. Often on gitter, so many conversations happened intertwined that I can't get the gist of it when I come back

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 27 2018 at 07:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030333):
I've come to accept it as a reality of live chats. One can't follow everything.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030334):
Yeah, it certainly has some benefits over the single linear thread.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030375):
But it does naturally require more thought.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030376):
As is the case for a message board or email.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030380):
For example, with an email, you have to choose a subject. For chat like Gitter, you don't.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Feb 27 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030385):

@**Sean Leather** That's true but you can still pick a subject halfway through

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 27 2018 at 07:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030430):
I am surprised this chat doesn't want me to specify my shoe size when I want to write a message. It feels like an official e-mail requires less mental overhead :).

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030480):

@**Moses Schönfinkel**  Are you saying that you've been reckless enough to not specify your shoe size? *gasp*

@**Sean Leather** @**Mario Carneiro**  I sense one more reason to stay

@**Moses Schönfinkel** Because you have sensitive feet? :footprints:

I'm happy to stay for the time being. There really was an issue on gitter with many overlapping conversations

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Feb 27 2018 at 07:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030540):
I don't know if this is the best solution, but I'd like to seriously try to acclimatize before I declaim it

I agree. I'm just giving my first impressions: a mix of good and bad, not too ugly.

It doesn't. (Mmm, deleting messages doesn't appear to be a thing here.)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030693):
Is there some way to bless a topic such as this one as the “default” topic? To avoid the needless spawning of new topics.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (Feb 27 2018 at 07:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030700):
the topics under stream are already sorted by most-recent-use; i don't think it's a big issue?

The fact that it even formats it is better than nothing, I guess. But, yeah, nothing like LaTeX for doing a proper integral.

```quote

Perhaps not. It *feels* like it is, because I'm forced to look at a list of topics under the stream and spend time thinking about it.

I see somebody change the topic, but my latest message didn't make the deadline.

Oh there's a list of topics under streams... I've been clicked on the "All messages" thing.

@**Simon Hudon** So the topic changed from your last message? That's interesting, I guess.

Oh, I see now that you can change the topic when you edit a message.

I think it's not really well made though. Maybe I should have announced "Changing topic name"

Oh, that's sneaky. So, I can choose to change the topic for any thread and force all of the following messages onto that topic.

Right now @**Sean Leather** , you could go at the beginning of this segment and merge back into the topic I created

So, topics are not first-class. You can merge messages just by changing the name of the topic.

So, I should not even be expecting a message board here. Topics are usually decided universally on a message board. But here, it's haphazard.

No, I mean I see the "quick mode" rendering of MathJax, as opposed to the "professional style" that it normally updates to after a few seconds on other sites

FWIW the lack of threads on gitter didn't bother me as there was rarely more than one or two going on at once. What was really beginning to bite me on gitter was that the search was so poor -- I never even figured out how to search for e.g. "all comments from Johannes made between 1 and 3 months ago", which was something I really wanted to do a day or two ago. Also there was a scroll bug, and there was unread messages bugs etc (but these were more minor in the sense that I had figured out workarounds)
