<p>I must say that the linear conversation of Gitter is easier to follow. This interleaving of streams and topics: having to figure out where the conversation flows and which topic to post to is a bit of a cognitive load for casual chat.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030150):
<p>Perhaps I'm expecting a chat service when maybe I should be expecting a message board.</p>

#### [ Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 27 2018 at 07:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030208):
<p>I completely agree, this is just a dash too much perusing and clicking around and such.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 27 2018 at 07:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030310):
<p>That's too bad. I really like this one. I especially like that it makes it easier to join a conversation after it ran for a while. Often on gitter, so many conversations happened intertwined that I can't get the gist of it when I come back</p>

#### [ Moses Schönfinkel (Feb 27 2018 at 07:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030333):
<p>I've come to accept it as a reality of live chats. One can't follow everything.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030334):
<p>Yeah, it certainly has some benefits over the single linear thread.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030375):
<p>But it does naturally require more thought.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030376):
<p>As is the case for a message board or email.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030380):
<p>For example, with an email, you have to choose a subject. For chat like Gitter, you don't.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 27 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030385):

<p>I am surprised this chat doesn't want me to specify my shoe size when I want to write a message. It feels like an official e-mail requires less mental overhead :).</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030480):

<p>I'm happy to stay for the time being. There really was an issue on gitter with many overlapping conversations</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Feb 27 2018 at 07:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030540):

<p>I agree. I'm just giving my first impressions: a mix of good and bad, not too ugly.</p>

<p>It doesn't. (Mmm, deleting messages doesn't appear to be a thing here.)</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Feb 27 2018 at 07:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030693):
<p>Is there some way to bless a topic such as this one as the “default” topic? To avoid the needless spawning of new topics.</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Feb 27 2018 at 07:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/How%20do%20we%20like%20Zulip/near/123030700):
<p>the topics under stream are already sorted by most-recent-use; i don't think it's a big issue?</p>

<p>The fact that it even formats it is better than nothing, I guess. But, yeah, nothing like LaTeX for doing a proper integral.</p>

<p>Perhaps not. It <em>feels</em> like it is, because I'm forced to look at a list of topics under the stream and spend time thinking about it.</p>

<p>FWIW the lack of threads on gitter didn't bother me as there was rarely more than one or two going on at once. What was really beginning to bite me on gitter was that the search was so poor -- I never even figured out how to search for e.g. "all comments from Johannes made between 1 and 3 months ago", which was something I really wanted to do a day or two ago. Also there was a scroll bug, and there was unread messages bugs etc (but these were more minor in the sense that I had figured out workarounds)</p>

<p>The problem is VSCode formatted copy, which is currently not disable-able, but you can work around it by pasting into notepad or a new plain text file in VSCode (to strip the colors), and then copying that text and pasting here</p>

<p>I can't reproduce the issue, but try Ctrl+Shift+V</p>

<p>Another annoying thing about Zulip is that the Android app sometimes doesn't want to refresh and show new messages.</p>

<p>Ctrl-Shift-V doesn't work for me on Firefox. I don't know if Firefox knows about formatted paste</p>

<p>By the way, has anyone noticed that the copy-paste bug from VSCode is fixed? Way to go Zulip!</p>
