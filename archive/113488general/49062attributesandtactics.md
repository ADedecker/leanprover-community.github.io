#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Mar 20 2018 at 20:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/attributes%20and%20tactics/near/123977846):
If I use `mk_simp_attr` to create an attribute, is there a way to set that attribute on a list of names? `tactic.set_basic_attribute` does not seem to do it.
