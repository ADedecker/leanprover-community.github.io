When I was learning about `set_option pp.all true` a while back, I had recently proved that there was no rational number whose square was 3 in Lean, in no doubt an extremely inefficient manner. I wrote the proof term to a file and I just ran into it again yesterday.

I emailed it to my 15 year old son and he imported it into Blender, thickened up the characters, and then ran a platformer game on top of it, with a character with a really bad jump and quite a good grapple trying to get from one end of the proof to the other

I have some video

Haha, sounds awesome

I'm just taking the sound off it. The hitbox of the character is really small. Sometimes my son just takes gravity off and randomly moves around the proof.

If he ever gets bored, he should play Celeste next :)

oh I am such an idiot I switched the video off when he landed on the proof. He grappled around for a while after that. You just see the bit where he falls through the letters a lot here

oh the grapple will have to wait, it's bed time
