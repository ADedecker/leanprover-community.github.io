<p>I think there are a lot of discussions at Zulip, which result in a PR. But often the discussion is missing in the pull request description. I have a hard time to follow all the discussions on Zulip, so I'm often missing why a parch in a PR is done in the specific way. Is it possible to have the discussions witch are PR specific on github itself?</p>
<p>For example for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339</a> I remember skimming over Zulip and that there was a discussion about the <code>coeff</code> map instead of using coercion to functions.</p>
<p>The advantage of linking of copying the discussion to the PR itself is that we can later see why a certain change was done. And I try to reference the github PR in the git commit message.</p>

<p>You could add a place in the "TO CONTRIBUTORS" text for links to any relevant zulip thread(s).</p>

<p>Oh, good idea!</p>

<p>Links back to Zulip are a start, but Johannes is right that for the longer term conversations archived on github are more useful. Unclear where the balance is!</p>
