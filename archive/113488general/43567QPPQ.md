gaargh I can't find

`example (P Q : Prop) : (¬ Q → ¬ P) → (P → Q) := sorry`

I understand it will be classical.something. I know `mt` (the other direction). I've looked in `logic.basic` but I couldn't find it (maybe I missed it). I want to find this with `#find` and not bother people here. But `#find (¬ _ → ¬ _) → (_ → _)` doesn't work for me. I want this to be easier. Help!

how do you use #find? #find doesn't work for me at all..

you have to import `tactic.find`

of course this is going to be in `logic.basic`

looks like it is `not_imp_not`

it's a biconditional, which is why find didn't find it the way you stated it

it's not classical.something because it has a decidability assumption

I didn't know whether to look in logic.basic or core. I've run into several issues like this recently. I am doing my undergraduate example sheets again, with an extra year of hindsight. Now I understand what "should be somewhere", so instead of proving things like this myself I try to find them. If I can guess the name then I'm in business, but my guesses failed me this time. Not knowing whether I should search for -> or <->, and not knowing where to look, doesn't help (I am slow at learning where things are because I can't pick stuff up as quickly as when I was younger -- I need machine assistance here ideally). 

None of
```lean
#find (¬ _ → ¬ _) → (_ → _)
#find (¬ _ → ¬ _) ↔ (_ → _)
#find (_ → _) ↔ (¬ _ → ¬ _)
```

give me anything. Why does the middle one fail? I have `logic.basic` imported. 

`not_imp_not : ∀ {a b : Prop} [_inst_1 : decidable a], ¬a → ¬b ↔ b → a`

What is the philosophy behind calling this `not_imp_not`? 

I really did try before I asked. It was the decidable v classical which caught me out.
