<p>gaargh I can't find</p>
<p><code>example (P Q : Prop) : (¬ Q → ¬ P) → (P → Q) := sorry</code></p>
<p>I understand it will be classical.something. I know <code>mt</code> (the other direction). I've looked in <code>logic.basic</code> but I couldn't find it (maybe I missed it). I want to find this with <code>#find</code> and not bother people here. But <code>#find (¬ _ → ¬ _) → (_ → _)</code> doesn't work for me. I want this to be easier. Help!</p>

<p>how do you use #find? #find doesn't work for me at all..</p>

<p>you have to import <code>tactic.find</code></p>

<p>of course this is going to be in <code>logic.basic</code></p>

<p>looks like it is <code>not_imp_not</code></p>

<p>it's a biconditional, which is why find didn't find it the way you stated it</p>

<p>it's not classical.something because it has a decidability assumption</p>

<p>I didn't know whether to look in logic.basic or core. I've run into several issues like this recently. I am doing my undergraduate example sheets again, with an extra year of hindsight. Now I understand what "should be somewhere", so instead of proving things like this myself I try to find them. If I can guess the name then I'm in business, but my guesses failed me this time. Not knowing whether I should search for -&gt; or &lt;-&gt;, and not knowing where to look, doesn't help (I am slow at learning where things are because I can't pick stuff up as quickly as when I was younger -- I need machine assistance here ideally). </p>

<p>give me anything. Why does the middle one fail? I have <code>logic.basic</code> imported. </p>
<p><code>not_imp_not : ∀ {a b : Prop} [_inst_1 : decidable a], ¬a → ¬b ↔ b → a</code></p>
<p>What is the philosophy behind calling this <code>not_imp_not</code>? </p>
<p>I really did try before I asked. It was the decidable v classical which caught me out.</p>
