<p>At tea today some colleagues expressed interest in learning about dependent type theory (interactive theorem proving may still be a bridge too far... :-). Does anyone have favourite recommendations for introductions, especially written for a "working mathematician" audience?</p>

<p>I'd be curious to see how far you can go using type theory as a tool without type checker</p>

<p>My angle on the subject has of course only been from the user's perspective so I'll admit that there's probably a whole world I know nothing about</p>

<p>hmm, i would recommend ncatlab to a mathematician... the references section seems through</p>

<p>I think the HoTT book is the best introduction to dependent type theory from a mathematician perspective</p>

<p>just remember to get off the bus when they start talking about iterated identity types :)</p>

<p>Great! I'm very happy that my first two suggestions have been echoed here. :-) I also like Mike Schulman's post at &lt;<a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/in_praise_of_dependent_types.html" target="_blank" title="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/in_praise_of_dependent_types.html">https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/in_praise_of_dependent_types.html</a>&gt;.</p>
