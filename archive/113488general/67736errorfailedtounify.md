### [error: failed to unify](67736errorfailedtounify.html)

I am at a stage where I am currently hitting errors of the following type
```lean
invalid apply tactic, failed to unify
  p.fst = q.fst
with
  ?m_2 = ?m_3
```
I have no clue why Lean can't unify those... probably there are some hidden metavariables somewhere... how do I get more info?

can you try to use `set_option pp.all true` and inspect the term again

Thanks, the response by Lean was a little bit overwhelming. But it solved my problem!
