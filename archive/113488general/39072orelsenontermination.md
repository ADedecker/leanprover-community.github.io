```
meta def foo : tactic unit :=
triv <|> foo

example : true := by foo
```
In this example I expected `foo` to behave just like `triv` since the right branch would never be used, but it times out. Is there a way to avoid this?

you can eta expand `foo` on the right

Another nice option is to use `local attribute [inline] interaction_monad_orelse`.

@**Mario Carneiro**  I thought you meant changing the body of `foo` to `triv <|> (Î» s, foo s)`, but this still times out. Am I doing something wrong here?

@**Gabriel Ebner**  That works. Thanks!

actually I think you have to eta expand the definition of foo itself, i.e. `def foo | s := (triv <|> foo) s`
