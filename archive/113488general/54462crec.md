I wrote a version of well-founded recursion which allows you to maintain a "consistency" condition in the recursion.

Compared to `well_founded.fix`, the difference is that you get to specify a condition `q : Π ⦃i j⦄ (h : i < j), C i → C j → Prop`. In the induction step you can assume that all the previous choices are consistent according to `q`, and you need to produce a new value which is consistent with all the previous choices.

In the end, you get a function whose values are all consistent according to `q`

Mostly it's useful when you need to have the consistency condition in hand in order to perform the next step of the recursive construction.

For example, you could take `C n` to be sequences defined up to `n`, and `q` to say that the first sequence is a prefix of the second

For example, suppose you want to construct an order-preserving map from `nat` to an order `P` without a greatest element. It's easy to prove by induction on `n` that there is an order-preserving map from `fin n` to `P`, but this is not good enough if these maps are all unrelated!

I think this could be stated as a "dependent choice" problem

you want the definition of `F a` to depend on `F b` for all `b < a`

ah, nevermind, I don't think I can simplify it past what you've already done. You want to define the type and value together in the recursion, but that's what `crec_core` accomplishes

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 27 2018 at 19:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/crec/near/148656406):
You can probably remove the `i < j` from `q`, since it's defining a prop

the `f` parameter of `H` can be uncurried, I don't know whether it is better or worse to also split it up into two parameters for the subtype in the target

Thanks for the suggestions. I haven't tried actually using this for anything yet, so I'll have to see what seems more natural at the use site.

@**Reid Barton** can I add `crec` to mathlib?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Jan 18 2019 at 00:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/crec/near/156330667):
Yes, absolutely.
https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-model-categories/blob/top-dev/src/logic/crec.lean is the version I actually use at the moment.
I think the usability could still be improved; in particular it's not very convenient to use `crec` and `crec_consistent` separately because you typically have to repeat `q`, which could be rather complicated.

`crec'` was an attempt to improve on that, but I still haven't found the best way to use it, for example https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-model-categories/blob/top-dev/src/top_small.lean#L110-L137 is a bit awkward.
