<p>I'm looking for a kind of semilattice with a bottom, and I'd like to be able to take the limit of a monotonically increasing series. Does it exist, is it in <code>mathlib</code> and what is it called?</p>

<p>This is often called a chain-complete partial order. I don't think it is in mathlib yet. I have a very old theory about the fixed construction,  but it doesn't compile anymore (see <a href="https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/900ec0250f46a2ac4070bfc4f4fd0405" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/900ec0250f46a2ac4070bfc4f4fd0405">https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/900ec0250f46a2ac4070bfc4f4fd0405</a> )</p>

<p>Cool! Thanks! Do you mind if I fix it up and PR it?</p>

<p>Of course! Go on.</p>
