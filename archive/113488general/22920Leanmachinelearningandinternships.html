<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Last summer, Koundinya (Kody) Vajjha, Joseph Tassarotti, and I have been using Lean to formally prove a (very basic) result<br>
in machine learning theory: that decision stumps are PAC learnable. I'm a machine learning researcher working in the industry and<br>
increasingly I have been feeling the need for more trustworthy machine learning applications. I started this project as an experiment <br>
to see how far we could get in a summer. We chose Lean because I had prior experience with Coq and we needed to build on the<br>
measure theory available in mathlib. It was a very positive experience, we finished the proof, and I really enjoyed working with Lean. </p>
<p>If you're interested, you can find the proof: <a href="https://github.com/jtristan/stump-learnable/wiki/A-formal-proof-that-decisions-stumps-are-PAC-learnable" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/jtristan/stump-learnable/wiki/A-formal-proof-that-decisions-stumps-are-PAC-learnable">https://github.com/jtristan/stump-learnable/wiki/A-formal-proof-that-decisions-stumps-are-PAC-learnable</a>. It was my first experience with Lean and I had not used a proof assistant in many years so I am aware that my proofs could use a lot of cleaning. The part of the development written by Kody is of course in much better shape. </p>
<p>We also put a paper on arxiv describing our work: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00385.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00385.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00385.pdf</a></p>
<p>As a side note, I'm thinking of doing some more work on using Lean for machine learning and I am looking for an intern.<br>
(to join me at Oracle Labs in Boston in the summer of 2020)<br>
Things we could work on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalizing the proof to higher dimensions, by using the Giry monad as much as possible</li>
<li>Proving Hoeffding inequality (a common tool in ML)</li>
<li>Working our way toward proving the VC inequality</li>
<li>Work related to fairness in machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested please send me an email! (<a href="https://jtristan.github.io/" target="_blank" title="https://jtristan.github.io/">https://jtristan.github.io/</a>)</p>

<p>Nice work! Are you considering PRing the mathematical bits of your repo to mathlib?</p>

<p>There's a <code>to_mathlib</code> file in the repo.</p>

<p>Yes, we would certainly like to do so.</p>

<p>We split the proof in two folders for that reason. The results in the lib folder are more general and could potentially be contributed. The results in the stump folder are very specific to the machine learning result.</p>

<p>The <code>to_mathlib</code> file contains a few lemmas on integration, the Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, lemmas about the Giry monad on probability measures.</p>

<p>I also used the Dynkin pi-lambda theorem to prove that the product measure constructed out of the Giry monad is in fact a product measure.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible without Johannes' work. Many thanks to him!</p>
