<p>I noticed that <code>is_group_hom</code> has a field called <code>mul</code>, whereas I would expect it to be called <code>map_mul</code>. Similarly, in that namespace there is a lemma called <code>one</code>, and I would expect <code>map_one</code>. Etc...<br>
Can/should these be renamed?</p>

<p>I think yes. Same for linear map, group action etc.</p>

<p>Or maybe I have wrong expectations...</p>
