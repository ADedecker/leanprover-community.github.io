I noticed that `is_group_hom` has a field called `mul`, whereas I would expect it to be called `map_mul`. Similarly, in that namespace there is a lemma called `one`, and I would expect `map_one`. Etc...
Can/should these be renamed?

I think yes. Same for linear map, group action etc.

Or maybe I have wrong expectations...
