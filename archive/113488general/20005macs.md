Any mac users here? I'm trying to install lean on the mac in my new hotel room

Having trouble related to libgmp. Do people use brew?

Thanks. I managed to install brew and get it to build gmp without root access, but definitely we should figure out how to make this easier at some point

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 01 2018 at 21:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187759):
cocalc :-) Of course you're right though.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 01 2018 at 21:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187767):
Yeah but in this case I like that I don't have to trust this computer with any identifying information about myself

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 01 2018 at 21:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187807):
... any hints about typing # on a European keyboard?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 01 2018 at 21:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187814):
UK layout I think

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 01 2018 at 21:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187815):
Never mind, I "fixed" it

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 01 2018 at 21:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/macs/near/133187858):
