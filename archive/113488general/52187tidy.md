`tidy` has been merged! :tada: :tada: :tada:

Mathlib is looking in really good shape at the minute. Many unmerged things are either WIPs or very new.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 18 2018 at 17:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134173949):
@**Scott Morrison** does mathlib's `tidy` not contain "backwards reasoning"? Or am I just not seeing it?

At least the version merged in Orsay didn't

I see. That throws a minor :wrench: in my `continuity` plans, but nothing too serious

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Sep 18 2018 at 17:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134175083):
Actually I'm curious to know why we got that nerfed `tidy`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Keeley Hoek (Sep 18 2018 at 18:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134175465):
@**Reid Barton** not Scott but that's currently still chilling out in https://github.com/semorrison/lean-tidy/tree/master/src/tidy

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 18 2018 at 18:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134175925):
Thanks Keeley!
Patrick, I wonder too. It looks like `backwards_reasoning` is fairly simple.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 18 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134176805):
In particular I'm not sure whether I should try to PR backwards_reasoning into mathlib, or roll my own version to use in continuity

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 18 2018 at 22:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134190776):
No, it's not there yet. It wasn't necessary for the early parts of the
category theory library, so I took it out just to reduce the initial PR
footprint.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 19 2018 at 03:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134203898):
I agree it would be good to get in soon. It was written before `ext` was available, and the appearance of `ext` took away a lot of the need for the "more aggressive" `backwards_reasoning`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 19 2018 at 03:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134203908):
I think it would be worth rewriting `backwards_reasoning` one more time, looking to see what we can share with `ext`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 19 2018 at 03:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134203956):
I'm trying to catch up on non-Lean life this week, so if someone wants to go ahead with a PR, please do, otherwise I'll do it "soon".

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134300961):
@**Reid Barton**, @**Patrick Massot** (et al.)
I've found there a two types of lemmas one frequently wants to apply backwards reasoning with. The "strong" variety are just lemmas that you always want to `apply` whenever they match. There's also a "weak" variety where you want to make sure that any hypotheses of the lemma can be immediately discharged from hypotheses.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134300973):
In my first implementation of `backwards_reasoning`, I introduced two attributes `@[back]` and `@[back']` for labelling the strong and weak cases.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134300978):
This is terrible naming!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 12:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134300995):
But I'm unsure what the right way to handle this is. Any suggestions welcome, and I'll get on with a `backwards_reasoning` PR.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 12:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134301093):
(I've decided my limits PR may be painful without having `backwards_reasoning` available.)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Sep 20 2018 at 14:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134305714):
How about `@[backward]` and `@[strong_back]`? Also, do you have an example of the kind of proof it does?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Sep 20 2018 at 14:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134305766):
You could also go with `@[backward strong]` and `@[backward weak]` with `weak` being the default?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 20 2018 at 14:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134306006):
I'll (eventually) prepare some examples; at the moment everything I have is invisible, because `tidy` is just doing it in secret. :-) I think actually `strong` should be the default --- for lemmas that are "safe" to always apply, whereas `weak` is the more dangerous "you can apply this, but you have to be careful you can actually immediately solve all new goals" setting.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Sep 20 2018 at 15:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134307560):
How about `@[back!]` and `@[back]`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Sep 20 2018 at 15:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134307631):
or `@[back]` and `@[back?]`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 20 2018 at 15:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134308545):
I would just comment that the "safe"/"unsafe" terminology can be confusing--if you mark something as "safe" when it's safe to apply and "unsafe" otherwise then it's "more safe" (i.e., more likely to be correct/sound) to mark something as "unsafe" than as "safe".

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 20 2018 at 15:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134308897):
For example the Haskell FFI uses `safe`/`unsafe` in the opposite sense from your terminology: `unsafe` is used to mark a function which is called "unsafely" (without any special setup/teardown), which means it had better be a function which is "safe" to call from any context (e.g., `sin`). `safe` means that the RTS will prepare a safe context from which to call the function, so it's safe to import most functions as `safe`. I'm used to this naming convention but I know some people find it confusing.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Sep 20 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/134309283):
Back on topic, I'm not sure I have a good intuition for which lemmas should fall into either of these two categories.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastien Gouezel (Oct 30 2018 at 14:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136775268):
Is there a way to tell `tidy` that is should never unfold something, possibly with some attribute? Whenever there are real numbers involved, it unfolds them to Cauchy sequences. For instance,
```lean
lemma foo {x : ℝ} : 0 ≤ x :=
begin
  tidy,
  sorry
end
```
gives a goal of the form
```lean
x_val : ℕ → ℚ,
x_property : is_cau_seq abs x_val
⊢ 0 ≤ quot.mk setoid.r ⟨x_val, x_property⟩
```

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Oct 30 2018 at 14:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136775987):
unfolding real numbers should be tagged `untidy`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805385):
Ugh, that is bad. :-) I'll admit I've never touched a real number in Lean!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805448):
The problem is just that `auto_cases` applies first, and it, somewhat ridiculously, runs `induction x` immediately.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805492):
There are certainly cases where this _is_ helpful behaviour, on the other hand.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805504):
I wonder if there is a useful line to draw.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805597):
One dumb solution is to just remove induction on quotients from `auto_cases` entirely, and have users of `tidy` explicitly add back in a tactic that does this (e.g. the very blunt `case_bash` tactic I have somewhere, which just tries cases on everything!)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 30 2018 at 21:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136805706):
I suspect that the occasions where it makes sense to use induction on a quotient, the quotient relation is "very near at hand". But I'm having trouble thinking how to quantify/measure that.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastien Gouezel (Oct 31 2018 at 08:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136831493):
Is the induction on quotients often helpful? I mean, if you remove it from `auto_cases`, does it break something in your category library? If not, I guess it is safe to remove it. Otherwise, one would need a mechanism to fine tune it, maybe with some attributes..

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 11:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136838627):
It breaks exactly one thing, and clearly that doesn't justify the hassle caused elsewhere. I'll PR a one line change to auto_cases soon*.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 14:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136850749):
Ok, I've PR'd this one-line change: https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/451

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastien Gouezel (Oct 31 2018 at 14:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136853102):
Thanks!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885843):
Huh, it turns out someone else was using `tidy` in a way that relied on induction on quotients: https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib/jobs/448843966

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885847):
I can just rewrite that proof.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885905):
An alternative would be to have `auto_cases` perform induction on "things that are explicitly quotients"

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885914):
For one, this would include things that actually match `quot _` or `quotient _`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885931):
But for this use case I'd also want to to fire on `quotient_module.quotient`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 31 2018 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136885944):
And it seems the only way to handle that would be to make decisions based on the _name_ itself.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Oct 31 2018 at 23:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136886552):
Yes there's a huge difference between real numbers as quotient and quotient modules as quotients! I guess another fix would be to rewrite the real numbers as Dedekind cuts ;-)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Floris van Doorn (Oct 31 2018 at 23:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136886818):
Or make `real` irreducible (after the file `data.real.basic`) and not unfold irreducible definitions?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 01 2018 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136913655):
Hmm, it seems making `real` irreducible doesn't work; lots of things fail.

e.g.  `rw div_mul_div at this` producing:

I don't really understand how reducibility caused a problem there.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Nov 01 2018 at 12:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136914854):
The issue is that this expression no longer type checks after real is made irreducible
```
example : @cau_seq.completion.has_mul ℚ _ ℚ _ abs _ =  (show has_mul ℝ, by apply_instance) :=
```
`real.mul_self_sqrt` uses `cau_seq.completion.has_mul`, so you end up with two `has_mul`'s that are no longer reduced to the same thing.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Nov 01 2018 at 12:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136915002):
Making `cau_seq.completion` irreducible instead might be a better idea.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 01 2018 at 12:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tidy/near/136915843):
Thanks! I will investigate that.

Hmm, making `attribute [irreducible] cau_seq.completion.Cauchy` (is that what you had in mind, @**Chris Hughes**?) seems to cause troubles later:
```
/Users/scott/projects/lean/mathlib/analysis/real.lean:185:29: error: type mismatch at application
```
Perhaps this is a dead-end.

I tried making real irreducible immediately after `exists_sup` and that seemed to work. Two proofs in analysis broke, but they were easy to fix.

Would you be interested in pursuing that to a PR? (Both because I think you'll do a better job at it that I would, and also I need to go to sleep? :-)

Done some investigation. There's some weird behaviour going on.

Not quite sure why all the data is equal by `rfl` but none of the proofs. @**Mario Carneiro**, what's happening?

I don't have the setup to test that myself right now, but if they are proofs then it should be an easy rfl, as long as the statement itself typechecks
