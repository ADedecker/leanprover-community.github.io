<p>A group of us are trying to write up a paper that describes the design and organization of mathlib. There are around 65 contributors to mathlib so far. Rather than attributing the paper to some subset as authors, we thought we'd submit it as a community effort. All contributors will be acknowledged, and none will be official authors. As well as a (hopefully) nice paper, this should be good high-level documentation about the library.</p>
<p>What this means: as community members, you can help us write the paper :) there are a few things we'd like to include that anyone could tackle. One is documentation, e.g. <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/linear.20algebra.20documentation.20push" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/linear.20algebra.20documentation.20push">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/linear.20algebra.20documentation.20push</a> . It can be tough to document something you didn't write yourself, but if you're partially familiar with some of it, this could be a good way to learn more.</p>
<p>Something else we'd like are pictures. It would be great to include e.g. graphs of the import structure, (parts of) the type class hierarchy, etc. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> has a script here that's a great start for graphing the import structure, but it needs some small fixes and some attention to format a pretty graph.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you're willing to help out with some of this!</p>
