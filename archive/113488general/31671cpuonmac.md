Anyone had an issue with lean using > 95% cpu on mac?

lean often takes up as much cpu as it can. It depends on what you are doing

Just opened the workspace

If you import a heavy theory, it may take a few minutes

You can also try building the lean files with `lean --make` to help speed it up

Yulia -- I'll be in the MLC in about an hour. You might want to build your mathlib (make all the .olean files) if this is constantly happening.

it went down to 20%, but now that i've open

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 11:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132034787):
*opened a file, it's back up to over 300%

@**Kevin Buzzard** I'll do that now üëçüèº

This is not abnormal behaviour -- the first time Lean starts up it might have to do a lot of work. It could be building the real numbers from the axioms of mathematics, for example. It only needs to do this once though.

Ok, so I've built lean and the cpu remains around 90% - is that normal? or is there a way of decreasing it even more?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 13 2018 at 12:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036480):
are there yellow bars in the gutter of vscode?

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 12:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036563):
nope

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 12:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036614):
only green, blue and red

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 13 2018 at 12:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036632):
does lean have the :check: in the status bar?

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 12:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036633):
oh actually, yes, in some files

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 12:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036698):
yep, there's a :check: but some files are highlighted yellow

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 13 2018 at 12:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036726):
maybe it would be best to wait for Kevin

#### [Yulia Zaplatina (Aug 13 2018 at 12:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cpu on mac/near/132036829):
