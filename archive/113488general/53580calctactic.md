I just noticed that `calc` is an interactive tactic which somehow unfolds to `exact calc` by magic
```lean
example (x : â„•) : x + 0 = x :=
begin
  calc x + 0 = 0 + x : add_comm _ _
         ... = x : zero_add _
end
```

I'm not sure exactly how this works, since `tactic.interactive.calc` doesn't exist

yep, it's hardcoded - `calc` turns into `exact calc` (https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/src/frontends/lean/tactic_notation.cpp#L273-L276)
