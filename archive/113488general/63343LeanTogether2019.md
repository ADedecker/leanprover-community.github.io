Hi everyone! @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl**  and I are organizing a Lean workshop in Amsterdam, Jan 7-11 2019. https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/ The meeting will also be a "kickoff" for Jasmin Blanchette's new project, Lean Forward: https://lean-forward.github.io/

Please put the dates in your calendars. We'd love to see lots of you there.

So lean-forward is doing number theory in Lean, but there are no number theorists involved? This is just like the ERC grant which Cambridge holds -- they want to do maths but there are no mathematicians? Is this some big grant which was recently funded? CS grant funding agencies are funding computer scientists again and again to do mathematics, but mathematics funding agencies do not seem to be (other than Sloan and Hales I guess). I should probably apply for some money. I wonder what the maths funding agencies would think? They might have real trouble getting referees :-/

What does "Our vehicle will be Lean, a disruptive proof assistant developed at..." mean? Is it any more disruptive than any other proof assistant?

I think he considers himself a number theorist! He certainly approved the text in the grant proposal before it was submitted, at the very least.

Oh that's *definitely* number theory! It is also completely impossible to do in Lean :-/ This needs all of the Wiles/TW machinery -- is the proposal to do that in Lean? ;-)

Indeed Sander Dahmen is actually employed by a mathematics department! i retract my assertion that there are no mathematicians involved :-)

> Russell quipped that "the method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." However, for most mathematicians, this fundamentalism is unappealing and unrealistic. Modern research on Diophantine equations often depends on the modularity of elliptic curves, which constitutes the final step in the proof of Fermat's last theorem and relies on an overwhelming amount of theory. Full formalization being unrealistic, we will embrace flexible levels of formality.

Bumping this thread up to the top! We've added a bit more information to the Lean Together website. https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/index.html

If you're free the week of January 7-11 and want to make the trip to Amsterdam, we'd love to see you there.

I don't know how to coordinate video recordings of the talks. But I plan to figure it out before January 7.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Oct 14 2018 at 21:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20Together%202019/near/135789752):
The hotel explanations on https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/index.html are a bit vague, so we may end up very scattered if everyone tries to find a hotel independently. It would be friendlier if we coordinate a bit. Are there already people here who studied the question and decided something?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Oct 14 2018 at 21:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20Together%202019/near/135791113):
It's a bit vague because I don't know anything about hotels in Amsterdam and just copied from Jasmin's last workshop website. :slight_smile: If I remember right, some people at that workshop stayed at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel and didn't complain. It's close to the university, farther from the more exciting parts of town.

I'm not complaining, I really mean what I wrote: I'd prefer to stay in the same hotel as other participants, so let's coordinate.

I am pretty sure that my _department_ has various agreements with specific local hotels.

Sure -- if you decide on something I'm happy to update the website and point people in that direction. Our university has some kind of arrangement with some hotels, but I'm told they're expensive and the closer hotels aren't part of it.

It should be university level negociation, not workshop level

Yeah, ideally, but based on what I'm told about booking hotels through the university, someone's already messed that negotiation up.

(Scroll down to the bottom if you want to read the question first :upside_down:) Here is one challenge that we might want to think about. There will be a bunch of mathematicians attending the conference that have no prior experience with ITPs as far as I know. (I know at least three participants come from the Dutch arithmetic geometry community.) The goal of this workshop, and of Lean Forward in general, is to work towards ITPs that are actually used by mathematicians; and that is exactly what my goal is (and Scott's, Patrick's, Kevin's goal as well). I know that mathematicians have not shown very much dedication towards ITPs, and this might be frustrating for some people from the CS side. To make these people stay we will have to address the following issue:
These people work with abelian schemes, Galois representations, F-isocrystals, Artin stacks, etc... these notions are not fancy for them, they are their basic Lego blocks. These concepts have been around for at least 30 years, more like 60. When they visit Johannes's talk on what's in mathlib, they will find that schemes and perfectoid spaces haven't made it into mathlib, even though Kevin (and Kenny, Patrick, me) have been working on them for around a year.
And then they will remember the talk from the day before, about Lean 4, and how that's around the corner. And they will hear some chat during the coffee breaks that porting to Lean 4 is going to be a bit of a nasty issue. And they will realise that none of their basic building blocks has ever made it into Coq, Isabelle, Mizar, or whatever.
So... long story short: how are we going to convince them (and me?) that all this formalisation effort is not ephemeral, and that ITPs should stabilise in the near future?

We don't even have a working definition of perfectoid spaces yet. And that definition is completely useless without theorems about them. To prove interesting theorems requires at least 10x as much work as defining them. So there we are 3 mathematicians working on a definition for 1 year. My guess is that we are 10 years away from using "almost mathematics" to compare the "etale site" of a "perfectoid field" with its "tilt". That theorem would be immensely useful, but all those words need a lot of work to get them into Lean. We could crowd source this, but the crowd will only help if their work doesn't become obsolete before it is even finished.

you can't even convince programmers to formally verify their software :p so why should the working mathematician? even so, I appreciate that people are interested in ITPs, and these early adopters will surely influence future progress in the area

> how are we going to convince them (and me?) that all this formalisation effort is not ephemeral, and that ITPs should stabilise in the near future?

Because now that Lean makes it possible for even mathematicians to write new tactics, we're seeing all sorts of new kinds of automation appearing, reducing the barrier of drudgery usually imposed by an ITP.

(And this automation runs quickly, and is being enthusiastically adopted in the mathematical library, and .... oh.)

I think in some ways it's a bit sad that there are relatively few "converts" from Coq and Isabelle/HOL to the Lean world. Those worlds did a great job of building community, funding, infrastructure, jobs for people, etc, and so of course they have strong attachments. But it's too much to expect individuals to change. :-)

When they visit Johannes's talk on what's in mathlib, they will find that schemes and perfectoid spaces haven't made it into mathlib, even though Kevin (and Kenny, Patrick, me) have been working on them for around a year.
```
I think it's a bit misleading to say we've been working on perfectoids for around a year. One year ago I was about to install Lean (Github says I managed to install Lean on November 25th, it's almost my  Lean birthday!) and you were pretty far away if I remember correctly. Since then we (Kevin, you and me) have been using Lean only part-time, and the perfectoid project began on June 2nd. More importantly, as I told you in Freiburg, we need to read again and again the second message in the perfectoid thread: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/Perfectoid.20spaces/near/127308229 We asked "what should  we do?" to one of the (two or three?) people who worked from the beginning to the end on the single huge pure math formalization project ever. And then we completely ignored the answer, and didn't write a detailed roadmap. I think there is hope for more efficient future projects.

Indeed, I have no desire to try to tell a crowd of mathematicians that "all this formalisation effort is not ephemeral, and that ITPs should stabilise in the near future." Neither of these statements are true, at least from a mathematical perspective. But that doesn't mean that there's no value in working on these projects right now, and it shouldn't stop people from doing that work if they understand the situation.

The audience here won't be a random selection of people. They'll all have been convinced to attend a workshop specifically about formal mathematics. If they learn the current state of things and get scared off, it doesn't bother me so much -- we won't have to deal with them complaining about why nothing works. :) The point is to catch the people who are interested enough to deal with all the shortcomings, and get them to help fix some of those shortcomings.

With that said, there's probably a better ordering of talks that puts some more optimistic ones earlier on. The schedule is guaranteed to shift around before January and I'll keep this in mind!

Maybe proofs written in a hierarchical style (with intermediate steps spelled out with `have Ïâ; have Ïâ; â¦`) would help make them robust and portable across versions? One could rely on ATPs to re-prove the low-level steps when changing versionsâ¦
