<p>DeMillo, Lipton, and Perlis (Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs) seem to believe that a proof checker has to grind a proof all-the-way-down every time. That is, the proof checker cannot assume that axioms hold and that every axiom needs to be re-proven as it is used. Is this how the lean proof checker works? Or does it 'believe' an axiom?</p>

<p>Axioms are not proven at all. That's what makes them axioms.<br>
Do you have in mind lemmas? Of course Lean does not re-check the proof of a lemma every time it is applied.</p>

<p>I thought that was the case but, since I'm writing that refutation, I thought I'd 'fact check' it. Thanks.</p>

<p>Fetzer (Program Verification: The Very Idea) seems to claim that algorithms are appropriate subjects for verification but programs are not. This seems to me to undercut the idea that 'programs are proofs'.</p>

<p>Programs aren't the same as proofs. Programs are a certain kind of proof. Lean is quite happy with proofs that aren't programs. Mathematicians use the word proof to mean something more general than a program</p>

<p>The whole point of lean4 is that more of the prover is in lean itself, but using <code>meta</code>, right? So that's a lot of programs that are definitely not proofs.</p>

<p>I agree that proofs are not (or need not be) programs. But "programs are proofs" is stated quite plainly in a whole stack of books on my desk. Fetzer seems to disagree.</p>

<p>A very restricted subset of programs, with rich types, functions that are total, and no effects, may be considered as proofs of their type being inhabited. 99.99% of actual programs people write and execute are not proofs <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>Also I couldnâ€™t, with a very quick glance, find anything in the first paper about axioms having to be proven.  Where do they say that?</p>

<p>The view that everything needs to be re-proven seems (to me) to be implicit in their argument against verification. Social processes allow "proofs" to hand-wave the assertion that "we could prove it down to the metal if we wanted". They argue that verifications will involve dozens of pages. A verification of the GCD algorithm, if everything is expanded in all its glory (i.e. reproven) might take several pages but mathematical proofs rest on prior proofs, making them shorter, so I don't see that their objection is reasonable.</p>

<p>Indeed, Dijkstra hand-proved a lot of his programs.

<p>Given that (some) programs are proofs, is there an example of a program that gets accepted by Lean?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>AFAIU <code>meta</code> is gone in lean4.  However many interesting parts are implemented using an FFI to C++ code, and for those functions that are imported from C++ you can only prove that they produce <em>some</em> result value, but not which one.</p>
