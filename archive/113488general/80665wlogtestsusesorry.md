<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="simon.hudon@gmail.com" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span>, I noticed your tests for the <code>wlog</code> tactic contain sorries, and these cause warning messages when compiling mathlib. Perhaps this is worth fixing, so we can all have clean outputs.</p>

<p>And what about taking docstrings and tests and extract a documentation from them, as my conversion mode doc?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="patrickmassot@free.fr" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/fa255396ff01ea2c0aaef1a2a1000fb03f217468" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/fa255396ff01ea2c0aaef1a2a1000fb03f217468">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/fa255396ff01ea2c0aaef1a2a1000fb03f217468</a> and I'm not sure what you're alluding to. Are you saying that this doc is extracted automatically from Lean code?</p>

<p>No it's not. That why some more work is required (I could do it if nobody else does it but it will probably introduce errors).</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 09 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508966):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="scott@tqft.net" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> You're right, it is annoying. I try not to make my goals <code>true</code> so that tactics don't accidentally discharge it before the interesting bit of the proof. I'm going to try something less noisy</p>

<p>I manually copied docstrings from the source</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508995):
<p>(and reorganized them a bit)</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508998):
<p>You could write a tactic program to do that <span class="emoji emoji-1f606" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>(not the reorganization part)</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509044):
<p>My hope is that this doc is more visible here than in the source code</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509051):
<p>But maybe it's me refusing to understand that source code is the documentation</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509064):
<p>I think we discussed tactics extracting docstrings back in the gitter days</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 09 2018 at 22:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509092):
<p>We definitely want a documentation generator at some point</p>

<p>I'm sure Simon could do it. Sebastian, have you seen the tactic Simon wrote for <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-differential-topology/pull/1/files" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-differential-topology/pull/1/files">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-differential-topology/pull/1/files</a> ?</p>

<p>I think you should carefully read what that guy writes in the monad thread <span class="emoji emoji-1f609" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509200):
<p>When I have 5 minutes to kill I sometimes  randomly look at the monad review discussion.</p>

<p>I didn't create a fake Github account only to post a link to the Lean FAQ :<span class="emoji emoji-1f61c" title="stuck out tongue winking eye">:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</span></p>
