@**Simon Hudon**, I noticed your tests for the `wlog` tactic contain sorries, and these cause warning messages when compiling mathlib. Perhaps this is worth fixing, so we can all have clean outputs.

And what about taking docstrings and tests and extract a documentation from them, as my conversion mode doc?

@**Patrick Massot** I'm looking at https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/fa255396ff01ea2c0aaef1a2a1000fb03f217468 and I'm not sure what you're alluding to. Are you saying that this doc is extracted automatically from Lean code?

No it's not. That why some more work is required (I could do it if nobody else does it but it will probably introduce errors).

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Mar 09 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508966):
@**Scott Morrison** You're right, it is annoying. I try not to make my goals `true` so that tactics don't accidentally discharge it before the interesting bit of the proof. I'm going to try something less noisy

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508978):
https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/tactics.md is _not_ autogenerated

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508988):
I manually copied docstrings from the source

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508995):
(and reorganized them a bit)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 09 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123508998):
You could write a tactic program to do that :laughing:

(not the reorganization part)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509044):
My hope is that this doc is more visible here than in the source code

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509051):
But maybe it's me refusing to understand that source code is the documentation

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509064):
I think we discussed tactics extracting docstrings back in the gitter days

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 09 2018 at 22:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509092):
We definitely want a documentation generator at some point

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509141):
I'm sure Simon could do it. Sebastian, have you seen the tactic Simon wrote for https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-differential-topology/pull/1/files ?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509160):
I think you should carefully read what that guy writes in the monad thread :wink:

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509200):
When I have 5 minutes to kill I sometimes  randomly look at the monad review discussion.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509263):
But I resisted when reading https://github.com/leanprover/lean/pull/1881#discussion_r173307598

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 09 2018 at 22:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wlog%20tests%20use%20sorry/near/123509279):
I didn't create a fake Github account only to post a link to the Lean FAQ ::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
