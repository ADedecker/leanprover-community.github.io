maybe create a structure generated by `x` and `f x` and use `no_confusion`

well that is indeed the Church encoding of the unit type

but, I mean, if X is `int` and `f` is negation then we all know it's false

In the formalism of "theorems for free", you can state something even stronger than `free_fun` there: every closed term of type `∀ (X : Type), X → X` is the identity function

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Apr 29 2018 at 07:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843540):
but you can't prove it

I mean, you can prove it, but you can't assume in Lean that every function has a closed term

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Apr 29 2018 at 07:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843580):
right, it's a metatheorem of the logic, so it's not to say that `\forall (r : ∀ (X : Type), X → X) (a : Type) (x : a), r a x = x` is inhabited

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Apr 29 2018 at 07:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843581):
(which I think is what Kevin meant to say)

it is of course false that `\forall  (X : Type) (f : X → X) (x : X), f x = x`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Apr 29 2018 at 07:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843588):
and in lean, it's not even true at the meta level because of non-parametric functions based on `choice`

Reid asks if it's true for computable functions, and it's not, trivially; every functor `Type -> Type` is computable simply because `Type` is erasable

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Apr 29 2018 at 07:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843682):
However, if you avoid choice according to `#print axioms`, then I believe it to be true, although that's a future project

project? can you ever check whether a function uses an axiom inside?

no, it would be a metatheorem

i.e. a section in my paper

but you could formalize such a proof in lean by creating tactics that produce the appropriate free theorem and prove it, failing if they run across an instance of choice

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Apr 29 2018 at 07:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/f%20x%20%3D%20x/near/125843782):
Dang, I was only thinking about `Prop` being erasable.

Furthermore, Kevin claims that he uses `choice` in his definitions, and I actually doubt it, since I'm talking about the type operator itself
