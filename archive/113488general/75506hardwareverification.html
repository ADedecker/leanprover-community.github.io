<p>I've been looking at "verification down to the metal". Robert Baruch has been designing a CPU in an FPGA and documenting each step with video. One of his videos is "Very Basic Introduction to Formal Verification" which involves formal verification of Verilog (hardware design language) modules. See (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw</a>) and also the paper "Veriflog Synthesis and Formal Verification with Yosys" (<a href="http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf">http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Yosys is using things like BDDs or model checking. But a lot of "metal" level "modules" in Verilog are basically either Mealy or Moore state machines. It seems to me that these could be modelled in logic and Lean-like proof machinery could be applied. I'm reading a book on hardware state machines at the moment with an eye towards a potential implementation. That would mean that, for instance, microcode implementations would be fully verifiable at the hardware level.</p>

<p>Lean seems to have an advantage over, say ACL2, in that we have dependent types. It should be possible to declare a 'register type' that knows the size of the register, for example.</p>

<p>Lets play 'assume'. Assume you can prove that a hardware finite state machine (FSM) implements a specification. (Since the implementation is finite state then it seems you can use a SAT solver?). Assume that the specification is Lean's proof checker (so the FSM can check a Lean proof). Assume the state machine(s) is small enough to fit in an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) (which are huge these days). Then there is a piece of hardware to proof check. Note that the large data center companies (but not ordinary mortals) have access to the new Intel CPU which has a built-in FPGA. So... one could have a hardware "instruction" to check a proof.</p>

<p>(sorry, wrote thread). A more (mealy?) interesting question: Can CIC be implemented in finite state machines?</p>

<p>What's the actual question? Of course everything is possible in principle</p>

<p>The X86 instruction set is beyond my powers to fully specify (I've tried). So trying to validate an implementation is also outside the possible (at least for me). However, an "instruction set" that is specific to proof checking and/or CIC and is well designed (say, as an FSM) then it would be easier to validate.</p>

<p>In addition, data centers used FPGAs all over the place (e.g. they run compression algorithms "on the wire" so the CPU can send/receive at higher bandwidth, they run encryption/decryption "on the wire" so data in flight can't be read or modified). So if code "carried proofs" then you could check, in parallel, that the code is valid.</p>

<p>Modern Intel CPUs contain an FPGA which, in principle, allows you to define your own instructions. So you could "side load" a proof checker.</p>

<p>So you package the proof checker FPGA binfile, the code, the code proof, all "under signed encryption", and then I (well, not <em>I</em> since I don't have access to the new CPUs) can send a "proven GCD" algorithm.</p>

<p>I have a couple FPGAs and I'm looking at the question of validating FSMs for my own chosen instruction set. The game is to design the instruction set to underlie the proof checker.</p>

<p>Rather than a Peano succ(succ(succ zero))) computation you'd rather work in normal machine binary (which, as I understand Univalence, says they are "equal"). So Lean can use much higher level (h-level) kinds of reasoning if you can "insert a computer algebra system" into Lean. But you need proven algorithms, presumably "down to the metal".</p>

<p>Yes, this is possible, but lean is not optimally positioned for such an effort. You really want a simplified kernel that doesn't take tens of thousands of lines to write and especially to specify</p>

<p>I've been looking at your paper on the Type theory of Lean, trying to figure out how to wedge that into Andromeda</p>

Or maybe two checkers, the second of which would be on his FPGA.</p>

<p>Comments on your x86 paper.</p>
<p>(1) "information on Linux system calls"... yeah, I had to skip over system calls in the 7000 page paper. System calls were "on the list" to be thought about but our Malware project got cancelled.</p>
<p>(2) "bootstrapping a theorem prover"... I can see where we've crossed paths. I gave up on the x86 path and decided to look at FPGA finite state machines (which a SAT solver can check). </p>
<p>(3) The link I gave above to the Baruch video "Very Basic Introduction to Formal Verification" shows a "prove" mechanism that can be applied to Verilog (hardware spec) code. It includes inductive proofs.</p>

<p>I don't handle very many linux system calls, but you need a few in order to do anything. I have <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>fstat</code> and <code>mmap</code>. In addition to that, you need to axiomatize the program loading behavior, which is surprisingly subtle and context dependent. I think it's not actually possible to guarantee that your program will not run out of memory and access out of bounds before it gets to the first line of the actual program (the ELF <code>_start</code> label)</p>

<p>(4) The 7k paper includes information on the ELF format, so we've both suffered through that.</p>

<p>The linking loader is a self-modifying program. It takes "data" of your program and "data" of libraries, constructs a program, and then "passes execution" to the constructed binary. I'm outlining a paper on "Self Modifying Code" using the linking loader as an example. The idea is to view the linking loader in a "continuation passing style" so the loaded program "returns to the linker.</p>
<p>The Tail-Called Linker<br>
It isn't what it was because it is gone.<br>
It isn't what it will be because it is becoming.<br>
But it alway is.</p>

<p>Not sure how much overlap there is with what you want to do, but I saw a talk once by Adam Chlipala about work his team was doing on verifying hardware/ISA stuff for riscv using coq and a tool they built in coq called Kami. The repo is still pretty active and seems to have examples, it might give you some insight into how people have applied a DTT-based prover to that domain.<br>
