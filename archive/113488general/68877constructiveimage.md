<p>Maybe we should define the image of a map f:X-&gt;Y to be X quotient by the relation that x~y iff f(x)=f(y)</p>

<p>is this how it is done in HoTT?</p>

<p>That is usually called the coimage, I think: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimage" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimage</a></p>

<p>hmm, I've never heard of coimage.</p>

<p>I think using this instead of the usual image will make things more constructive</p>

#### [ jmc (Mar 27 2018 at 19:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124282326):
<p>O.o... you are heading down the constructive path? It seems that happens to every one who starts doing formal proofs...</p>

#### [ jmc (Mar 27 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124282343):
<p>Anyway, even in classical maths you need the isomorphism theorem to tell you that coimage = image</p>

<p>In certain settings that theorem might fail</p>

<p>E.g. in topology: you will get the same set, but the quotient topology on the coimage may be finer then the subset topology on the image</p>

<p>I've been walking in this path for some time</p>

#### [ jmc (Mar 27 2018 at 20:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124282734):
<p>Ok, never mind (^; I am wandering back and forth between constructive and classical maths as well</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 27 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124285270):
<p>Kenny, you should search for coimage on this Zulip forum</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 27 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124285326):
<p>(usable search is part of the reason why we switched from Gitter to Zulip)</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Mar 27 2018 at 21:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124285335):
<p>You should also stop this constructive madness but this is another story</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Mar 27 2018 at 21:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/constructive%20image/near/124285475):
<p>lol</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> I searched it and saw you crap-talking about constructivism :P</p>
