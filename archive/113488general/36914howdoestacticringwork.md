I have read through programming in Lean a couple of times and now wonder if it's time I started reading something else. I decided to read the ring tactic (not least because it failed to prove something relatively simple the last time I tried to use it and I'd rather fix it myself than pester Mario, not that I have any idea about how far I need to go before I am anywhere close to being able to fix it).

Anyway, I started to read it:

if anyone wants to help me understand it, they're welcome to edit the rst file. Note: I wrote `ring_ractic.rst` in sphinx not markdown. It's still human-readable and pretty easy to pick up.

Typo: "especially if one does it within Lean (thus gaining the ability to hover over or click on functions and see their type, definition and so on)." <-- you mean VScode instead of Lean, right?
Another typo: "Note that evem though" <-- s/evem/even/

Thanks. I had a look through all of tactic.ring and really it doesn't look too bad. I'm currently reading http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/courses/tt-2014/read/10.1.1.61.3041.pdf Assia's take on the matter (which I think was Mario's source for his code)

One insight which dawned on me is that there are two completely different issues involved with writing a ring tactic. Maybe everyone else is aware of this.

Let me explain my understanding of what the ring tactic does.

Let's say `d : int` and we want to prove `d^2 + 2*d + 1 = (d+1)^2`

If we want to prove this using `ring` then we are saying "this is not true because of something specific to int, this is a general fact about rings"

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jun 12 2018 at 11:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/127945501):
So what we actually want to do is to prove that $$X^2+2X+1=(X+1)^2$$ in $$\mathbb{Z}[X]$$

and then deduce our goal by specialising to $$X=d$$

This makes it clear what we have to do here.

we will need polynomials in a finite set of variables.

Of course Lean has these.

Once we have this new type, we need to prove an "evaluation theorem", saying that if $$f(X)=g(X)$$ in our polynomial ring

Along the way it would be natural to prove things like $$f(d)+g(d)=(f+g)(d)$$ and so on

So we define our new polynomial type, define evaluation, prove nice properties about the evaluation map

we need to manufacture `X^2+2*X+1` in our polynomial ring type.

And for this we really need to take apart `d^2+2*d+1` and see how it is built from `d` and stuff that has analogues in the polynomial ring.

@**Simon Hudon** Assume Lean has a working polynomial ring type `ZX` (there are some kicking around, but perhaps none in mathlib) representing polynomials with integer coefficients in one variable `X`.  Am I right in thinking that it doesn't even make sense to ask for a function (in Lean's sense) which sends `d^2+2*d+1` to `X^2+2*X+1` where `d : int` is some variable? I can't even imagine what the domain of such a function would be. On the other hand, would I be able to write a tactic which took the expression `d^2+2*d+1` as an input and spat out `X^2+2*X+1`?

certainly given `d^2+2*d+1` as an `expr` (and let's say `d` is also given, as an `expr`), in meta land we can construct `X^2+2*X+1`.

Sorry, the example wasn't very helpful: I just meant, determine if some expression is in fact a polynomial in some other expr, and if so, present it as such in some form (list of coefficients, map of coefficients, etc).

@**Simon Hudon** No I think it's more. X is a genuine polynomial variable, we have a type `ZX` with an inclusion from int into ZX and also some element `X : ZX` which is not in the image of `int`, it's an abstract polynomial variable

I can see that Mario's implementation uses "Horner form" of a polynomial, so sparse polys are handled better.

If you don't need access to meta-land features like general recursion or `expr` then you can stay in normal-land; and surely the theory of $$\mathbb{Z}[X]$$ doesn't need these things. On the other hand, you may want to avoid using noncomputable things if you want your tactic to, for example, be able to decide whether two polynomials in $$\mathbb{Z}[X]$$ are equal so that it can decide whether to succeed or fail.

Yes, it's perhaps doing something clever like not just implementing addition, it's also collecting the proofs that addition commutes with evaluation, but the five lemmas before `eval_add` are precisely the five lemmas you need to add polynomials in "Horner form"

Maybe this will help: There is an implicit inductive type `horner_form_expr` with the following definition:
```
meta inductive horner_form_expr : Type
| const : expr → horner_form_expr
| horner (a : horner_form_expr) (x : expr) (n : nat) (b : horner_form_expr) : horner_form_expr
```
The job of `eval_add` and the other definitions is to rewrite any `expr` into a `horner_form_expr`. However, since `horner_form_expr` can be represented as an `expr`, the actual inductive type is omitted to avoid the overhead of converting back and forth. Furthermore, there is a normal form requirement, that says that the `x` expression must be lex_lt less than any other expressions in `x` slots of the `b` subtree.

Right -- I had basically figured this out. But you see, in some educational blog post about this stuff you could put this type in, and furthermore make it work in a more stupid way using lists of coefficients. What I am still not clear about is whethet you can get away with making it not meta (and hence get away with not actually writing it at all, because it's already written)

Because you're in meta-land you can just not even define the type, you can `destruct` it _assuming_ that it's in this form, and if it's not then big deal, things have gone wrong, just return `none`

One way to see the difference is in the proof: A tactic that does proofs by meta-induction produces proofs that get longer as the theorem gets harder to prove, but a proof by reflection is relatively short, with the generated proof being proportional to the *statement* in length

Ironically I fired up pari-gp and computed (a+b)^12 in a gazillionth of a second and then cut and pasted the output into Lean in order to see if it could do something which I already had a much better tool for.

The third is a bit more annoying. Because there is no algorithm to put polynomials (= lists of znums) into "canonical form", `example (x : ℤ) : (x + 1) + ((-1)*x + 1) = 2 := by do ring_tac ```(x) ` fails

> Why `@[derive has_reflect]`

This one is easy: otherwise you don't have a `reflect` instance for `ring_expr`. This function is used explicitly in `ring_tac`; the idea is that if `A` is a reflectable type then `reflect (a : A)` is an expr that denotes the same value as `a`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001637):
so for example `list` has a reflect that just turns each cons into a `expr.app ``list.cons a l`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001644):
and `nat` has a reflect that produces `bit0` and `bit1` expressions (which when printed appear as the number being denoted)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001686):
But not all types have a reflect; in particular quotients and other things that make different expressions equal according to lean don't have a reflect, since you would have to open up the quotient to get the element to print

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001696):
In this case it is needed because `reflect_expr` produces a `ring_expr`, not an `expr` denoting a `ring_expr`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001746):
I think in this case you could skip the extra step and just produce an expr directly, but that would be less structured and more meta

> Why `znum`

This one is more subtle, and actually I knew you would ask this question and I used it in part to prompt the question. You can view this as an efficiency move, but when there is an exponential performance gap I think it is close enough to essential to teach directly. Whenever you use proof by reflection, it is absolutely essential that you do everything you can to make the computation simple and direct, because you will be working with a fairly heavy handicap. A big no-no is using `nat` and `int` anywhere in your computation, because (as Seul has discovered) this works in unary and there is nothing you can do to prevent this when computing in the kernel

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jun 13 2018 at 12:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/how%20does%20tactic.ring%20work%3F/near/128001891):
This is in fact the raison d'etre for the `num` type - it allows for performing *kernel computations* on naturals and integers, with enough lemmas to relate them back to the more traditional `nat` type.

It's a bit of a delicate move, since `int` and `nat` are in fact the more efficient ones in VM computations, so you want to convert from `int` to `znum` when storing the numbers inside the kernel data structure (`ring_expr`), but not before

> The third is a bit more annoying. Because there is no algorithm to put polynomials (= lists of znums) into "canonical form", example (x : ℤ) : (x + 1) + ((-1)*x + 1) = 2 := by do ring_tac ```(x) fails

I noticed this as well with your definition of `poly.add`. But there is actually another solution, which might be easier than applying a function that strips the high zeros after every operation. That is, define
```
def poly.is_eq : poly -> poly -> bool := sorry
```
so that trailing zeros are ignored in the equality test, and then replace `to_poly e1 = to_poly e2` with `poly.is_eq (to_poly e1) (to_poly e2)` in the `main_thm` and prove it with this (weaker) assumption

So, if I defined a new poly type quotiented with this equality relation, I'd have to explicitly define my denotation function? That doesn't sound so bad, I think... or would the kernel get stuck trying to reduce it?

Your definition didn't work on `poly` because it uses well founded recursion, which is another kernel no-no (it has to unfold the well foundedness proofs)

Try this instead:
```
def poly.is_zero : poly → bool
| [] := tt
| (h :: t) := (h = 0) && poly.is_zero t

def poly.is_eq : poly → poly → bool
| l₁ [] := poly.is_zero l₁
| [] l₂ := poly.is_zero l₂

(Alternatively, if you defined subtraction or an equivalent you could use only `is_zero` and define `is_eq` by `(p1 - p2).is_zero`)

I read and enjoyed your blog post! My only comment is perhaps you might have a further reading section. It would be a good place to link http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Reflection.html and https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vfa-current/Decide.html#lab185 for people who are trying to seriously write a reflective tactic (although, unfortunately, you have to read Coq to understand what's going on... but I think at this stage of Lean's popularity, this is somewhat necessary regardless in the tactics game). Also, minor nitpick, but `znum` is only uber-efficient when it is used in `rfl` proofs, otherwise `int` has special fast support

Many thanks Andrew. I am not a computer scientist as I'm sure you know and I don't really know about references. I have looked, briefly, at both of the things you mention, but I have never really substantially engaged with them -- I tend to stop reading when things get "too CS" because they become less relevant to what I am trying to do in Lean. Thanks for the nitpick too.

> Why bool and not Prop?

Because you can't compute with Props. You could get roughly the same behavior by using `decidable p` instead of `bool` (+ soundness proof), but since there are more dependency tricks there I suspect it's marginally slower than using bool (but not by any large margin).

In this case, the bool definition functions both as the relation itself and its decidability proof. If you wanted to use decidable, then, it would be two definitions and a soundness proof
