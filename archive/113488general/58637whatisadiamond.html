<p>What is a typeclass diamond (note : this has nothing to do with Scholze's diamonds, it's an unfortunate name-clash)? I think it's something like the above link. Two distinct instance routes from A to D, with typeclass inference giving us two terms of type D which are provably distinct. I am assuming that the system should be regarded as having failed at this point. How much can I get away with? I think there are other lower category diamonds as well though, right? What other things can go wrong? Instances which are equal but not computably equal? Instances which are equal but not definitionally equal? Is there some sort of complete catalogue of diamonds?</p>

<p>With regard to auto-naming, what do you think a good strategy for naming those would be? It would <del>probably</del> be really easy to implement</p>

<p>I was going from <code>xena.B</code> to <code>xena.D</code> in my example, in the xena namespace, and getting a name which depended only on <code>D</code>. I guess I want to have B tagging along somehow. Is there some clever thing you can do with dots?</p>
