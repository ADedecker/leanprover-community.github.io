<p>my understanding was zulip uses an old version of pygments, and that the lean pygments update was never merged to begin with</p>

<p>which is a bit disappointing</p>

<p>i think pygments for lean is still on highlighting based on lean 2's syntax, iirc</p>

<p>yeah, first i think we'll need to submit a support ticket to zulip and see if they will fork pygments for us, and then we can update the pygment's lexer file for lean</p>

<p>I've already checked with the Zulip devs and they would be happy to fork pygments if there is a request to do so.</p>

<p>If someone here can produce a patch then I can take care of getting it upstreamed</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Jan 15 2019 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155163511):
<p>I ran all of mathlib and a couple of my projects through Gabriel's pygments fork, using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>find . -name &#39;*.lean&#39; \( -exec ~/.local/bin/pygmentize -l lean -F raiseonerror &#39;{}&#39; &#39;;&#39; -o -exec echo $&#39;\npygmentize failed:&#39; &#39;{}&#39; &#39;;&#39; -quit \)
</pre></div>


<p>There was just one lexer error, it doesn't know about the escape sequence <code>"\t"</code>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> should I submit a PR, or would it be easier for you to just fix it yourself?</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Jan 15 2019 at 12:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155163531):
<p>(Minimum failing example: <code>example : string := "\t"</code>)</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Jan 15 2019 at 12:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155163672):
<p>It also doesn't know about <code>"\x12"</code>, <code>"\u1234"</code>, or <code>"\'"</code> (I checked the Lean source to see what escape sequences exist)</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jan 15 2019 at 13:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155163795):

<p>I think you can get pwned with <code>-exec</code> if someone writes a malicious mathlib PR, although I've never understood the details (I read this in the find man page)</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Jan 15 2019 at 14:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155168459):
<p>I know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> was also having LaTeX problems with some specific characters but I don't know whether that's something that would be fixed within pygments or outside it</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 15 2019 at 14:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155168553):
<p>Reid, you only need to try using pygment with LaTeX to see it's all broken, and needs fixing from pygment</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 15 2019 at 14:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pygments/near/155169307):

<p>of course the <code>newunicodechar</code> lines are ugly, and you can't even do it once and for all because of TeX super small memory capacity. But this is not related to pygment</p>

<p>AFAIR, we at some point declared a "fallback" token class in the Lean pygments tokenizer so that it should never fail on an unknown notation now</p>

<p>About the PR, here is a rule of thumb: each time GitHub says "Large diffs are not rendered by default" you may consider splitting in smaller bits</p>

<p>I think if you want reasonably fast merging you should aim for &lt;200 lines per PR. If you are adding a new file, I guess you can make them a bit larger. But everything &gt;500 lines seems to just rot away in the queue.</p>

<p>My question was mainly a joke, of course I won't PR it in one go. And yes, I will wait for the refactoring before I submit anything. By the way, I am really happy to have done something in Lean (define the space of all nonempty compact metric spaces, with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance) that does not even make sense in Isabelle.</p>

<p>I understand that. But my distant memory of GH distance between X and Y  involve sending X and Y into any other metric space. Is such a definition already problematic (and only heuristic) in set theory?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Textbooks do not really go to such details, but they should: if you say "all compact metric spaces up to isometry", this is not well defined (but if you notice that the cardinal of such a space is bounded, then everything is easy to solve). In the same way, if you say "send X and Y to all metric spaces", this is not well defined, but in fact all that matters is the union of the images of X and Y, which is compact and therefore has bounded cardinal. This is essentially what I do, saying that it is enough to consider embeddings in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">‚Ñì</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">‚àû</mi></msup><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N})</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">‚Ñì</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathrm mtight">‚àû</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> to say something about all metric spaces.</p>

<p>Yes, because I prove that it gives what you expect: for any embeddings of X and Y in metric spaces, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between X and Y is bounded above by the Hausdorff distance of the images. And there is one such embedding that realizes the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.</p>
