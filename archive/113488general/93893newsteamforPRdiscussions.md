<p>I've just created a new stream, after a brief discussion with Mario, for discussion of current PRs.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 07 2018 at 12:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347484):
<p>Let me cast the first vote: Merge <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/397" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/397">#397</a> Now!</p>

<p>My main idea is that it is a place for everyone-besides-Mario-and-Johannes to ask each other for help and reviews, without it constituting nagging Mario-and-Johannes.</p>

<p>I think it would also be helpful if many more of us participated in reviews of PRs. (I'm certainly too lazy here.)</p>

<p>And hopefully it's okay for anyone to give a "positive review" of a PR --- simply chiming in that they've either looked at the changes and they seem good, or even better that they've tried them out in some way.</p>

<p>This should then make it easier for Mario and Johannes to deal with the easy ones that don't need significant input from them.</p>

<p>Yes, I did try 397, it works here. We only miss a VScode one key stroke trick to insert {!!} and Ctrl-.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 07 2018 at 12:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347870):

<p>I've redone my Banach's Contraction Theorem PR (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/428" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/428">#428</a>) to use the material pointed out by Patrick, I think it's ready now!</p>
