I've just created a new stream, after a brief discussion with Mario, for discussion of current PRs.

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 07 2018 at 12:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347484):
Let me cast the first vote: Merge [#397](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/397) Now!

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 12:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347486):
My main idea is that it is a place for everyone-besides-Mario-and-Johannes to ask each other for help and reviews, without it constituting nagging Mario-and-Johannes.

I think it would also be helpful if many more of us participated in reviews of PRs. (I'm certainly too lazy here.)

And hopefully it's okay for anyone to give a "positive review" of a PR --- simply chiming in that they've either looked at the changes and they seem good, or even better that they've tried them out in some way.

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 12:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347551):
This should then make it easier for Mario and Johannes to deal with the easy ones that don't need significant input from them.

/me approves

Yes, I did try 397, it works here. We only miss a VScode one key stroke trick to insert {!!} and Ctrl-.

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 07 2018 at 12:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347870):
Oh, it's merged now!

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 07 2018 at 12:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/135347871):
Thanks!

I've redone my Banach's Contraction Theorem PR (#428) to use the material pointed out by Patrick, I think it's ready now!

#### [Johan Commelin (Dec 11 2018 at 16:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/151452979):
@**Rohan Mitta** There is a separate stream for PR's as announced in this thread. I created a thread there for your PR.

#### [Johan Commelin (Dec 11 2018 at 16:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/new%20steam%20for%20PR%20discussions/near/151453001):
