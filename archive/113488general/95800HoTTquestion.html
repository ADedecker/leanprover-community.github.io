<p>I've been chatting to Martin Escudo, someone who knows a lot more about univalence than me. My understanding of one of his claims was that it was impossible to define (in Lean) a predicate P on types such that P(nat) was provably true and P(int) was provably false. His argument seemed to be that a sufficiently large part of univalence was consistent with Lean. However he said that for functions from Type to Type one could find such functions P in the presence of global choice. My understanding of his claim is that he's saying the following is provable in Lean:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>In words: in the presence of what he calls "global choice" (c) one can find P : Type -&gt; Type such that P(X) is inhabited but P(Y) isn't, for some isomorphic X and Y. Have I understood him correctly?</p>

<p>Your formal statement is certainly false, since you are claiming that this property holds of all P</p>

<p>I don't think the claim you attribute to Martin is true either though; even in the presence of global choice it's still possible that <code>nat</code> and <code>int</code> are literally different names for the same underlying type</p>

<p>I agree with this</p>

<p>I disagree with this unless "find" is meant in a sense other than "there is a definable lean term P such that P(X) is provably true and P(Y) is provably false and X ~= Y is provable"</p>

<p>Aren't I claiming that if univalence holds for all P then we have a contradiction?</p>
