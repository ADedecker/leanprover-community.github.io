<p>Is definitional eta for structures something we are likely to get at some point?</p>

<p>I'd be surprised.</p>

<p>In the absence of eta, another feature request would be "lazy matching" in lambdas and lets</p>

<p>analogous to ~ patterns in Haskell</p>

<p>For everyone else, this means <code>位 \&lt;x,y\&gt;, x + y</code> gets desugared to <code>位 p, p.1 + p.2</code>.  I don't think it is planned, but you might be able to do the desugaring yourself.</p>

<p>There are some definitions in data.equiv for example which I can't use conveniently, because they match on the input equivalence before producing a constructor.</p>

<p>But rewriting them with the constructor outermost becomes quite ugly.</p>

<p>(not at computer, and don't remember the specific names)</p>

<p>Was imagining including a ~ in the syntax for lazy patterns, not changing the current semantics.</p>

<p>Though I wonder when you would ever want the "strict" version, figuratively speaking.</p>

<p>+1 I keep trying to type that and being disappointed.</p>

<p>Someone recently pointed out a mathlib definition that uses case analysis like this that was causing problems, but now I can't find it. Can anyone else find it?</p>

<p><code>+</code> and <code>*</code> in localization.</p>

<p>are you sure? I don't see that when I search in the chat</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Aug 04 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/eta%20for%20structures/near/130881181):
<p>I definitely made a comment about it, but there's probably something else as well.</p>

<p>ah, okay (I searched for "localization")</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 10 2018 at 23:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/eta%20for%20structures/near/135568699):
<p>Should we replace those definitions with the better definitions?</p>
