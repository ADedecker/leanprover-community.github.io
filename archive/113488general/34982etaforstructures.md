### [eta for structures](34982etaforstructures.html)

Is definitional eta for structures something we are likely to get at some point?

I'd be surprised.

In the absence of eta, another feature request would be "lazy matching" in lambdas and lets

analogous to ~ patterns in Haskell

For everyone else, this means `位 \<x,y\>, x + y` gets desugared to `位 p, p.1 + p.2`.  I don't think it is planned, but you might be able to do the desugaring yourself.

There are some definitions in data.equiv for example which I can't use conveniently, because they match on the input equivalence before producing a constructor.

But rewriting them with the constructor outermost becomes quite ugly.

(not at computer, and don't remember the specific names)

Was imagining including a ~ in the syntax for lazy patterns, not changing the current semantics.

Though I wonder when you would ever want the "strict" version, figuratively speaking.

+1 I keep trying to type that and being disappointed.

Someone recently pointed out a mathlib definition that uses case analysis like this that was causing problems, but now I can't find it. Can anyone else find it?

`+` and `*` in localization.

are you sure? I don't see that when I search in the chat

#### [Chris Hughes (Aug 04 2018 at 09:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/eta%20for%20structures/near/130881181):
I definitely made a comment about it, but there's probably something else as well.

ah, okay (I searched for "localization")

Should we replace those definitions with the better definitions?
