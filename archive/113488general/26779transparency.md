In `tactic.meta` there is a definition called `transparency`:
```lean
inductive transparency
| all | semireducible | instances | reducible | none
```
 which seems to be a setting for how aggressively definitions are unfolded. In the reference manual I see that you can set `reducible`, `semireducible` and `irreducible` as attributes. My impression is that these attributes and settings are used when doing unification or matching. I can't find any documentation on what *exactly* these different transparency modes are changing about the unifier. Please could someone explain it to me or point me to some docs or C++ code that will help me understand what is going on here?

So an example might be that you want `‚Ñù` to be irreducible because you rarely prove things about reals in terms of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences.

Sorry, probably such documentation doesn't exists. Gabriel and Sebastian are probably the people to hope can point you to right parts of the C++ code.
