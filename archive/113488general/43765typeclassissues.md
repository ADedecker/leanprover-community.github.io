#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 14 2018 at 20:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type%20class%20issues/near/147694692):
This is amazing: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcommelin/8736c28a8e74f3d478b1c2b7737fa513/raw/d655018af064ef75572afb17d2ffb7d051c500c0/crazy_type_class_error.lean
I feel like the algorithm could be a lot smarter here. For example, search for `x_52` on that page, and go to the first match. You will be on the last line of this chunk of code:
```lean
[class_instances] (1) ?x_32 : category
  (@comma {X // B X}
     (@category_theory.full_subcategory (@opens X _inst_1)
        (@site.to_category (@opens X _inst_1) (@category_theory.site X _inst_1))
        (Œª (X : @opens X _inst_1), B X))
     punit
     category_theory.punit_category
     (@opens X _inst_1)
     (@site.to_category (@opens X _inst_1) (@category_theory.site X _inst_1))
     (@full_subcategory_inclusion (@opens X _inst_1)
        (@site.to_category (@opens X _inst_1) (@category_theory.site X _inst_1))
        B)
     (@functor.of_obj (@opens X _inst_1) (@site.to_category (@opens X _inst_1) (@category_theory.site X _inst_1)) U)) := @category_theory.comma_category ?x_51 ?x_52 ?x_53 ?x_54 ?x_55 ?x_56 ?x_57 ?x_58
```
So basically it has already figured out all these type class instances, and it should immediately be able to fill in `?x_52` and friends. But it doesn't... and then it hits the search limit.

```lean
[class_instances] (4) ?x_238 : category punit := @category_theory.small_category ?x_422 ?x_423
```
goes all the way down to
```lean
[class_instances] (12) ?x_460 : linear_ordered_field punit := @discrete_linear_ordered_field.to_linear_ordered_field ?x_461 ?x_462
```
I guess it might be a good idea to insert a shortcut somewhere?

looks like the actual solution is `category punit := category_theory.punit_category`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Nov 14 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type%20class%20issues/near/147695801):
can we use instance priority to guide the search here?

the funny thing is that `punit`actually has a unique structure of all those classes it looks for

@**Reid Barton** I'm really confused, because a lot of the time it is finding that instance. But that sometimes it goes astray...

Well, it did find it here, eventually

Hmmm, would it be good strategy if Lean is searching for an instance of `foo bar` to first check if maybe `bar.foo` exists?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 14 2018 at 21:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type%20class%20issues/near/147696190):
Because that would find `punit.category` instantly...

Ahrg, this is so annoying. So now I can start writing lots of `@` signs, and insert the typeclass instances manually, and the code becomes unreadable...

Either :four_leaf_clover: will have to improve the instance search algorithm, or we will have to start being more careful about how we write instances, with other tradeoffs

We could have a strategy where we don't write instances like `instance [preorder Œ±] : small_category Œ±`, but rather `instance [preorder Œ±] : small_category (preorder Œ±)`, where `def preorder Œ± := Œ±`

That would cut out all the silly search starting `preorder punit` (actually it is not really silly, since `punit` could very well be a `preorder`, but anyways we want a different instance)

for preorder categories, I guess it depends on whether you view it as "a preorder is a special kind of category" or "any preorder can be equipped with a canonical category structure"

There are two essentially different kinds of instances: "parent coercions" that change the head, and things that change the type to something smaller and leave the head alone

we know the search terminates in the second case because it's well founded on the structure construction, and in the first case because our tree of classes is finite

@**Leonardo de Moura** Ok, I was hoping that maybe we could use priorities to guide the type class system. Anyway, thanks for the input! And thanks for all you're doing for Lean (3 and 4).

@**Johan Commelin** Yes, priorities will help. Shortcuts will help too. Example: https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/data/int/basic.lean#L418-L429

These are just workarounds.

It's not clear to me how much shortcuts actually help, though, because they make the typeclass graph even larger

if you have instances from A -> B -> C and add a shortcut A -> C, then a typeclass search for some unrelated F will traverse both paths to C (and possibly the entire subtree rooted at C)

Are there any plans for lean 4 to do anything with the typeclass system?

You can add the shortcuts using local attributes. In this way, you can add shortcuts to a file without affecting other files.

Sebastian and I discussed a few improvements (e.g., better indexing and caching), but as I said above these are just ideas on the whiteboard. We didn‚Äôt get there yet.
