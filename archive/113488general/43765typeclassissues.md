I feel like the algorithm could be a lot smarter here. For example, search for <code>x_52</code> on that page, and go to the first match. You will be on the last line of this chunk of code:</p>

<p>So basically it has already figured out all these type class instances, and it should immediately be able to fill in <code>?x_52</code> and friends. But it doesn't... and then it hits the search limit.</p>

<p>I guess it might be a good idea to insert a shortcut somewhere?</p>

<p>looks like the actual solution is <code>category punit := category_theory.punit_category</code></p>

<p>can we use instance priority to guide the search here?</p>

<p>the funny thing is that <code>punit</code>actually has a unique structure of all those classes it looks for</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> I'm really confused, because a lot of the time it is finding that instance. But that sometimes it goes astray...</p>

<p>Well, it did find it here, eventually</p>

<p>Everything looks more or less fine until the max depth error</p>

<p>Hmmm, would it be good strategy if Lean is searching for an instance of <code>foo bar</code> to first check if maybe <code>bar.foo</code> exists?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 14 2018 at 21:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/type%20class%20issues/near/147696190):
<p>Because that would find <code>punit.category</code> instantly...</p>

<p>Ahrg, this is so annoying. So now I can start writing lots of <code>@</code> signs, and insert the typeclass instances manually, and the code becomes unreadable...</p>

<p>I really doubt how this will scale</p>

<p>Either <span class="emoji emoji-1f340" title="four leaf clover">:four_leaf_clover:</span> will have to improve the instance search algorithm, or we will have to start being more careful about how we write instances, with other tradeoffs</p>
