<p>Is anyone working on a way to produce more mathematically-typical summaries of Lean theories?  This is an important part of the workflow in Mizar: see Bancerek (2006) "Automatic translation in formalized mathematics"; Bancerek et al (2018) "The Role of the Mizar Mathematical Library for Interactive Proof Development in Mizar".  I notice that the basic style in <code>mathlib</code> doesn't include a lot of comments, e.g., <code>continuity.lean</code> includes 7 doc strings and 120 lemmas.</p>

<p>I think you can find some of that documentation here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/tree/master/docs/theories" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/tree/master/docs/theories">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/tree/master/docs/theories</a></p>
