<p>I know this is fuzzy as hell, but I've run into the problem that when writing an automated tactic, <code>cases</code> fails for a goal in which it succeeds when I run <code>cases</code> manually. It fails with <code>cases tactic failed, it is not applicable to the given hypothesis</code>.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125991862):
<p>and what is the hypothesis?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125991869):
<p>Keep in mind that <code>tactic.cases</code> and <code>tactic.interactive.cases</code> are not the same. Does calling the other one result in the same thing?</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992075):
<p>I'll try</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992089):
<p>Oh, so <code>tactic.cases</code> lacks the generalizing part?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992145):
<p>I guess so</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 02 2018 at 14:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992222):
<p>The distinction between <code>tactic</code> and <code>tactic.interactive</code> is I think never mentioned in Programming In Lean, and caused me some grief when I discovered it the hard way (attempting to write basic tactics which ran tactics which were already there).</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 02 2018 at 14:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992263):
<p>(but in a different namespace :-) )</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992285):
<p>So does <code>begin ... end</code> open <code>tactic.interactive</code>?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992440):
<p>Not exactly. More accurate is that if the first token in an interactive script line is <code>token</code>, then that is interpreted as a call to the tactic <code>tactic.interactive.token</code></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992444):
<p>there is no elaborate namespace resolution like normal</p>

<p>Hmm okay... looking at the definition of <code>tactic.interactive.cases</code> it doesn't look like this is the problem here...</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992598):

<p>They're just composite names, because.... because I didn't know what else to do with them. Actually I'd want to put all of that <code>DC.M</code> into parameters of some section...</p>

<p>Structures aren't exposed to the meta languages, so I thought I'd spare me the work.</p>

<p>If you want, you can have a look at the mess that is my attempt to implement inductive-inductive types at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/javra/indind/src/master/" target="_blank" title="https://bitbucket.org/javra/indind/src/master/">https://bitbucket.org/javra/indind/src/master/</a></p>

<p>What do you mean by this?</p>

<p>Since I want to create all that stuff automatically, I need to rely on what's available to the meta language which afaik is just <code>add_inductive</code>. I'd have to define all the projections of the structure myself, no?</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 18:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126000435):
<p>Any more clues? :(</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 18:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126000989):
<p>It's not quite clear to me what you are trying to do, exactly. If you are doing an automatic theorem, presumably all the assumptions are generated from the inputs somehow? What is induction-induction and how does it map to your representation?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 02 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126001180):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110789">@Jakob von Raumer</span> It's so hacky I haven't even thought about it until now, but since you're inside a user-defined command, I guess you could define structures by assembling them as strings and passing them to the parser, like Gabriel did in hott3 <a href="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/ec79a762a478f775ca03de45361e215a5ad4c129/src/hott/init/meta/support.lean#L97-L98" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/ec79a762a478f775ca03de45361e215a5ad4c129/src/hott/init/meta/support.lean#L97-L98">https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/ec79a762a478f775ca03de45361e215a5ad4c129/src/hott/init/meta/support.lean#L97-L98</a></p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 02 2018 at 18:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126001274):
<p>This is quite fragile of course since the pretty printer doesn't always roundtrip, even with <code>pp.all</code></p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126004451):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I can tell you all of that but it's pretty irrelevant to my problem :D In short the thing I'm trying to write gets some expressions as input and adds some stuff to the environment. So yes, the type of the theorem I'm proving is generated with some steps from these inputs. <code>DC.SI</code>, <code>DC.Rarg</code> and <code>DC.rel</code> are all inductive types that I add via <code>add_inductive</code> before I get to prove the theorem with the goal which I stated above. (Said theorem I'm adding via <code>add_theorem_by</code>, so I assemble the type directly but prove the theorem itself by a tactic which I'm just about to write.</p>
<p>The question is just why I'm getting this error message instead of <code>cases</code> being sucessful in destructing <code>ar'</code>.</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126004480):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>  Oh wow, that's evil. Thanks for the pointer. But I guess I'd rather stay away from that :D</p>

<p>Ohhh could it be that cases just doesn't deal with inductive types that have been added using <code>add_inductive</code> when they lack <code>rec_names</code>, for example?</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 20:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126007262):

<p>Ah, I only tried <code>tactic.induction</code> before... The problem is not generalizing the expression itself but errors like <code>induction tactic failed, argument #8 of major premise type

<p>(this is with the 20/4 nightly)</p>

<p><code>cases</code> does <em>something</em> to generalize the arguments in the correct way that <code>induction</code> doesn't, it's not really about the recursor it uses</p>

<p>Do you think this will change in Lean 4?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 09 2018 at 16:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126316950):
<p>Lean 4 will probably not have any <code>ginductive</code>s</p>

<p>Care to elaborate?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 09 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126323093):
<p>With nested and mutual inductives moving into the kernel, there shouldn't be any need for an abstraction layer. Well, it's still not clear how nested inductives would be represented.</p>

<p>Why are they moved into the kernel if they can be reduced outside the kernel?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 09 2018 at 19:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126323646):
<p>They can't :) . The reduction rules are too weak, that is. Also, it's the most horrible part of the code base.</p>

<p>So I'll wait for Lean 4 or try to emulate what cases does for generalizing</p>

<p>Apparently the part I'm missing is mostly some magical <code>no_confusion</code> applications</p>

<p>Is it still Daniel who maintains the ginductive compiler?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (May 14 2018 at 09:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126525983):
<p>I think it's just Leo, who says he doesn't even understand the code any more</p>

#### [ Jakob von Raumer (May 14 2018 at 18:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126544666):
<p>That's bad news :(</p>
