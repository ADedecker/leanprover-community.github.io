#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125991838):
I know this is fuzzy as hell, but I've run into the problem that when writing an automated tactic, `cases` fails for a goal in which it succeeds when I run `cases` manually. It fails with `cases tactic failed, it is not applicable to the given hypothesis`.

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125991862):
and what is the hypothesis?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125991869):
Keep in mind that `tactic.cases` and `tactic.interactive.cases` are not the same. Does calling the other one result in the same thing?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992075):
I'll try

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992089):
Oh, so `tactic.cases` lacks the generalizing part?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 14:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992145):
I guess so

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 02 2018 at 14:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992222):
The distinction between `tactic` and `tactic.interactive` is I think never mentioned in Programming In Lean, and caused me some grief when I discovered it the hard way (attempting to write basic tactics which ran tactics which were already there).

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 02 2018 at 14:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992263):
(but in a different namespace :-) )

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 14:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992285):
So does `begin ... end` open `tactic.interactive`?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992440):
Not exactly. More accurate is that if the first token in an interactive script line is `token`, then that is interpreted as a call to the tactic `tactic.interactive.token`

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992444):
there is no elaborate namespace resolution like normal

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992549):
Hmm okay... looking at the definition of `tactic.interactive.cases` it doesn't look like this is the problem here...

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992598):
So the goal looks like this:
```
cases tactic failed, it is not applicable to the given hypothesis
state:
5 goals
DC.M.A' : Type,
DC.M.lt' : DC.M.A' → DC.M.A' → Type,
DC.M.iota_A : A → DC.M.A',
DC.M.mid : Π (DC.M.x DC.M.y : DC.M.A'), DC.M.lt' DC.M.x DC.M.y → DC.M.A',
DC.M.iota_lt : Π (a b : A), lt a b → DC.M.lt' (DC.M.iota_A a) (DC.M.iota_A b),
DC.M.mid_l :
  Π (DC.M.x DC.M.y : DC.M.A') (DC.M.p : DC.M.lt' DC.M.x DC.M.y), DC.M.lt' DC.M.x (DC.M.mid DC.M.x DC.M.y DC.M.p),
DC.M.mid_r :
  Π (DC.M.x DC.M.y : DC.M.A') (DC.M.p : DC.M.lt' DC.M.x DC.M.y), DC.M.lt' (DC.M.mid DC.M.x DC.M.y DC.M.p) DC.M.y,
b : DC.SI,
x : A,
a a' : DC.Rarg DC.SI.A',
ar : DC.rel DC.SI.A' (DC.S'.iota_A x) a,
ar' : DC.rel DC.SI.A' (DC.S'.iota_A x) a'
⊢ a = a'
```

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992608):
And the failing tactic is
```
b ←  i_to_expr ```(ar'),
cases_core b [],
```

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992624):
your local variables have namespaces?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992681):
They're just composite names, because.... because I didn't know what else to do with them. Actually I'd want to put all of that `DC.M` into parameters of some section...

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992700):
seems like you want a structure to hold all that

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992762):
Structures aren't exposed to the meta languages, so I thought I'd spare me the work.

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992767):
in any case I don't recommend variable names with dots in them

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992775):
not sure if it's causing the problem, but it might be related

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992779):
If you want, you can have a look at the mess that is my attempt to implement inductive-inductive types at https://bitbucket.org/javra/indind/src/master/

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992783):
Okay, thanks for the advice

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125992862):
> Structures aren't exposed to the meta languages, so I thought I'd spare me the work.

What do you mean by this?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/125993005):
Since I want to create all that stuff automatically, I need to rely on what's available to the meta language which afaik is just `add_inductive`. I'd have to define all the projections of the structure myself, no?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 18:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126000435):
Any more clues? :(

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 02 2018 at 18:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126000989):
It's not quite clear to me what you are trying to do, exactly. If you are doing an automatic theorem, presumably all the assumptions are generated from the inputs somehow? What is induction-induction and how does it map to your representation?

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 02 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126001180):
@**Jakob von Raumer** It's so hacky I haven't even thought about it until now, but since you're inside a user-defined command, I guess you could define structures by assembling them as strings and passing them to the parser, like Gabriel did in hott3 https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/ec79a762a478f775ca03de45361e215a5ad4c129/src/hott/init/meta/support.lean#L97-L98

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 02 2018 at 18:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126001274):
This is quite fragile of course since the pretty printer doesn't always roundtrip, even with `pp.all`

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 19:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126004451):
@**Mario Carneiro** I can tell you all of that but it's pretty irrelevant to my problem :D In short the thing I'm trying to write gets some expressions as input and adds some stuff to the environment. So yes, the type of the theorem I'm proving is generated with some steps from these inputs. `DC.SI`, `DC.Rarg` and `DC.rel` are all inductive types that I add via `add_inductive` before I get to prove the theorem with the goal which I stated above. (Said theorem I'm adding via `add_theorem_by`, so I assemble the type directly but prove the theorem itself by a tactic which I'm just about to write.

The question is just why I'm getting this error message instead of `cases` being sucessful in destructing `ar'`.

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126004480):
@**Sebastian Ullrich**  Oh wow, that's evil. Thanks for the pointer. But I guess I'd rather stay away from that :D

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 20:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126007194):
Ohhh could it be that cases just doesn't deal with inductive types that have been added using `add_inductive` when they lack `rec_names`, for example?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 02 2018 at 20:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126007262):
That would be a shame :disappointed:

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 03 2018 at 14:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126041805):
I got a MNWE here:
```
meta def add_stuff : tactic unit :=
do tactic.add_inductive `foo [] 0 `(Type) $
   [(`bar, expr.const `foo [])]

example : unit :=
begin
  add_stuff,
  have x : foo, exact bar,
  cases x,
end
```

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 03 2018 at 18:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126053566):
Does `is_ginductive` fail for the inductive types added by `add_inductive`? *guess*

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 03 2018 at 18:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126053612):
yes

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 03 2018 at 18:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126054107):
So there's just no way to use `cases` then? :(

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 03 2018 at 18:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126054191):
You can use `induction` :)

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 03 2018 at 19:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126054440):
`induction` doesn't do the generalizing itself, right?

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 04 2018 at 11:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126087605):
@**Jakob von Raumer** This one? https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/e181232c8ffd2bc2ba1b2f9799f8ac0ea0e4e505/library/init/meta/interactive.lean#L518

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 11:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126088668):
Ah, I only tried `tactic.induction` before... The problem is not generalizing the expression itself but errors like `induction tactic failed, argument #8 of major premise type
  DC.rel DC.M.A' DC.M.lt' DC.M.iota_A DC.M.mid DC.M.iota_lt DC.M.mid_l DC.M.mid_r DC.SI.A' (DC.S'.iota_A x) a
is not a variable`...

Isn't it a bit strange that the parsing bits of the interactive versions of these tactics are combined with adding more features?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126089062):
It seems pretty bad that I have to fiddle around with the parser monad :(

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 12:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126090649):
In that sense `cases` is stronger than `tactic.interactive.inductive`...

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 04 2018 at 12:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126090829):
Hm, I thought we generalized major premise in `induction` as well

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 14:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126092990):
At least not in the version I'm on right now (3.3)

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 14:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126092999):
The best solution for this mismatch would be to somehow expose `add_ginductive` to the meta language, I guess

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 04 2018 at 14:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126094398):
Well, why would you use such an ancient version :P

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 15:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126095025):
Well, in 3.4.1 it doesn't look any different ;)

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 15:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126095041):
I think it's about generalizing the _argument_ to the major premise, no?

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 15:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126095100):
What's your best guess for the amount of work it would be to add an interface `add_ginductive`?

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 04 2018 at 16:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126097169):

I saw that, yes, but that's still not as general as `cases`, otherwise the message `argument #8 of major premise type [...] is not a variable` wouldn't make sense. I'll try to come up with a small example...

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 04 2018 at 16:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126097901):
The generalization has some issues anyway, see for example the error that
```
inductive foo : bool → Type
| mk : foo ff

inductive bar : Π b, foo b → Type
| mk : bar ff foo.mk

example (y: foo ff) (x : bar ff y) : unit :=
begin
  induction x,
end
```
gives...

inductive bar : Π b, foo b → Type

`cases` does *something* to generalize the arguments in the correct way that `induction` doesn't, it's not really about the recursor it uses

With nested and mutual inductives moving into the kernel, there shouldn't be any need for an abstraction layer. Well, it's still not clear how nested inductives would be represented.

#### [Jakob von Raumer (May 09 2018 at 18:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cases/near/126323554):
Why are they moved into the kernel if they can be reduced outside the kernel?

They can't :) . The reduction rules are too weak, that is. Also, it's the most horrible part of the code base.
