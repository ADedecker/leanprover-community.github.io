mu2 is the inductive type with two terms: 1 and -1. It is closed under negation, multiplication, and power. This type casts to int as well as zmodp, and is injective as long as p is an odd prime. It can also be cast to the units of ang ring. This type can be used in defining the sign of a permutation, as well as for proving quadratic reciprocity. Without this type, we would need 1000 auxiliary lemmas in the form of (? = 1 or ? = -1). Are these reasons good enough to define this type?

It's already there and called `units int`

Then why didn’t you use it in your QR proof?

you used cases 4 times consecutively and produced 16 goals

I should have used it to define legendre sym?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 10 2018 at 12:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135532495):
legendre symbol can be 0, so don’t replace it with another definition. Instead, define another partial legendre symbol and prove that they are equal

do you have a better idea?

I don't see what problem this solves.

The legende_symbol takes values in `with_zero (units int)`

That said, I didn't give this issue that much thought, and it may well be better to change it. It will probably be changed if anyone wants to generalize stuff, and do the Jacobi symbol.

@**Kenny Lau** `def μ₂ := bool`. Does that work?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Oct 10 2018 at 13:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135536034):
Why would you define it again when there's already `units int`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Oct 10 2018 at 14:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135536510):
Because inductive types are pretty to work with?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Oct 10 2018 at 14:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135537768):
You can always define a `units_int.rec_on`, that looks exactly like what `mu2.rec_on` would look like. `mu2.rec_on` wouldn't even be that nice, because it would split it into the cases `mu2.one` and `mu2.neg_one`, not `has_one.one` and `has_neg.neg has_one.one`

These are interesting questions. They are pure implementation issues so as a mathematician with 30 years of experience I find that I have nothing to say. I guess one thing I don't understand is why it even matters. You make a random implementation decision and then you prove all the lemmas you need for your interface, and then who cares how the type is defined. Right? [I'm assuming not]

I don't suggest using `with_zero (units int)`, it doesn't interact with other numeric types well enough, I think

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 10 2018 at 22:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135566352):
I would just use `int` and prove that it has absolute value <= 1, or it is a unit if not zero, or something like that

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Oct 10 2018 at 22:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mu2/near/135566791):
Just use `X [has_one X] [has_mul X] [has_neg X]`
