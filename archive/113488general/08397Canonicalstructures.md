<p>Will there be, or is there, an analog of Coq's "canonical structures", complementary to typeclasses, in Lean? </p>
<p>For information about canonical structures, see Canonical Structures for the working Coq user, <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00816703v2" target="_blank" title="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00816703v2">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00816703v2</a>, Sandrine Blazy and Christine Paulin and David Pichardie.

<p>I've heard these things mentioned here in the past, and my impression is that at least some people seem to think that Lean's typeclasses are "better". Am I completely wrong about this?</p>

<p>Some old discussion on the same topic. If you have things to add I'm sure that people here would be interested.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for the link to this thread. I did a search before posting but didn't come up with this one.</p>

<p>I found it using search -- searching for canonical structures gave me a bunch of posts by me banging on about canonical isomorphisms of structures; I then realised that searching for "canonical structure" was a better idea.</p>

<p>About canonical structures, the only interesting thing I remember is that, in the Coq bigop paper, they insist a lot on the fact that canonical structures can be associated to terms and not only types, and this is meant to be a huge advantage over type classes. But this does not apply to Lean type classes. For instance the is_commutative type class in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/ceacfa7445953cbc8860ddabc55407430a9ca5c3/library/init/algebra/classes.lean#L13" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/ceacfa7445953cbc8860ddabc55407430a9ca5c3/library/init/algebra/classes.lean#L13">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/ceacfa7445953cbc8860ddabc55407430a9ca5c3/library/init/algebra/classes.lean#L13</a> is about a term.</p>
