<p>As you all know, I'm a newbie wrt ATP etc. Please let me pick your brains.<br>
Are there good examples/experiments/research papers that deal with autogenerating a bunch of boring lemmas, given some new definition.<br>
Let me put it this way. We teach Lean what a semigroup is, and it generates <code>semigroup.lean</code>. We teach Lean what a <code>monoid</code> is and it generates <code>monoid.lean</code>, and then <code>group.lean</code> and <code>semiring.lean</code> etc...<br>
The system could just go crazy and try to combine the axioms in all sorts of ways, and flood the file with all the trivialities it comes up with. It could score the lemmas by length of the statement, and keep the ones that are shortish. Autogenerating a name must be possible. It gets bonus points if it reuses previously proved lemmas in the proofs.</p>
<p>Of course this is all not very interesting for the files that we already have. But we'll have to write lots of such files in the future. I certainly wouldn't mind if the system would have generated <code>valuation/basic.lean</code> for us.<br>
Note that I'm really speaking of a one-time thing. It generates the file once, not every compile. So speed is not really an issue.<br>
And if we teach it the naming scheme, then the result should be pretty usable. Next step would be to recognize simp-lemmas, etc.</p>
<p>Just some random thoughts. Looking forward to yours.</p>

<p>(Although this was quite controversial when it came out.)</p>
