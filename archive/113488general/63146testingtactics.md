I have a `meta def T : expr â†’ tactic expr := ...` that I've written that isn't behaving properly, and I want to do some debugging. Inside the definition there are some `trace` statements that explain to me what's going on --- I just need a convenient way to invoke my tactic. Suppose I have some other `def f := ...`, and I want to invoke `T` on `f`. What do I do?

I'm hoping there's just something easy involving quotations that I don't know.

Something like ``to_expr `(f) >>= T`` should work

```term `(f) has type reflected f but is expected to have type pexpr```

Actually, `` `(f)`` is already an `expr`, so ``T `(f)`` should work

``` to_expr ``(f)``` works, however

You would use `to_expr` if you need to parse the expression at run time rather than parse time
