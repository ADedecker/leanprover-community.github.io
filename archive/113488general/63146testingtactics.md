<p>I have a <code>meta def T : expr â†’ tactic expr := ...</code> that I've written that isn't behaving properly, and I want to do some debugging. Inside the definition there are some <code>trace</code> statements that explain to me what's going on --- I just need a convenient way to invoke my tactic. Suppose I have some other <code>def f := ...</code>, and I want to invoke <code>T</code> on <code>f</code>. What do I do?</p>

<p>I'm hoping there's just something easy involving quotations that I don't know.</p>

<p>Something like <code>to_expr `(f) &gt;&gt;= T</code> should work</p>

<p><code>term `(f) has type reflected f but is expected to have type pexpr</code></p>

<p>Actually, <code> `(f)</code> is already an <code>expr</code>, so <code>T `(f)</code> should work</p>

<p><code> to_expr ``(f)</code> works, however</p>

<p>You would use <code>to_expr</code> if you need to parse the expression at run time rather than parse time</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
