<p>In the realm of computer algebra it seems that there are commonly accepted names that are used throughout mathematics which we implement. For instance, the sin, integral, subscript, coefficient, etc. In the data structures we find common names like first, last, map, rotate, etc. Sometimes these are not comon but still "reasonably obvious", such as in a DeRham Complex you find a function named "lieDerivative", which is a lie derivative.</p>
<p>So far, in lean and logic I haven't found "universal" naming to be the norm. Even in areas like group theory the naming convention seems non-universal. Given that some of these basic theorems exist in all of the systems, would it be a useful topic to try to converge on a "common core" naming of theorems?</p>

<p>An alternative might be to create a "rosetta stone" document, similar to one in computer algebra:<br>

<p>My admitedly limited understanding is that "proof irrelevance" implies that if something is proved in one system then it is true. So such a rosetta collection turns into both a cross-reference and a catalog of proven statements.</p>

<p>And if a theorem is proven true in one system, couldn't it be stated as an axiom in other systems? So the rosetta stone becomes a catalog of axioms.</p>
