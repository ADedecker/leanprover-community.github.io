<p>In the realm of computer algebra it seems that there are commonly accepted names that are used throughout mathematics which we implement. For instance, the sin, integral, subscript, coefficient, etc. In the data structures we find common names like first, last, map, rotate, etc. Sometimes these are not comon but still "reasonably obvious", such as in a DeRham Complex you find a function named "lieDerivative", which is a lie derivative.</p>
<p>So far, in lean and logic I haven't found "universal" naming to be the norm. Even in areas like group theory the naming convention seems non-universal. Given that some of these basic theorems exist in all of the systems, would it be a useful topic to try to converge on a "common core" naming of theorems?</p>

<p>An alternative might be to create a "rosetta stone" document, similar to one in computer algebra:<br>

<p>My admitedly limited understanding is that "proof irrelevance" implies that if something is proved in one system then it is true. So such a rosetta collection turns into both a cross-reference and a catalog of proven statements.</p>

<p>And if a theorem is proven true in one system, couldn't it be stated as an axiom in other systems? So the rosetta stone becomes a catalog of axioms.</p>

<p>Of course you can add axioms... but since there will be a human translation step involved when going from one system to the other, the trust level goes down.</p>

<p>Concerning "common core" names. I think it is very hard to come up with a practical naming system that everyone is happy with. I for one think that it would already be very helpful if we just add those "common core" names in the comments above theorems. For most applications that should also be sufficient.</p>

<p>Good point. On the other hand, with a list of proofs (say, from group theory) it would be possible to claim which ones were proven in Lean and which ones are axioms.</p>

<p>Assume a rosetta document (perhaps one similar to the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/" target="_blank" title="https://dlmf.nist.gov/">https://dlmf.nist.gov/</a> so that one could look up a theorem (because the "reference name" cites chapter/section/theorem. Along with the theorem from "the first prover" would be the actual proof. Theorems proven in other systems could be named in the same section. Theorems not listed are just axioms.</p>

<p>The "Digital Library of Mathematical Theorems" (DLMT) would be a useful collection, especially since it would show how to prove a theorem, despite syntactic / semantic mismatch. Indeed, if there was an natural language explanation of the proof it would be even more enlightening.</p>

<p>Such an effort would be an interesting sub-forum at conferences.</p>

<p>IF a system came up with a shorter or more obvious proof that replace the existing entry.</p>

<p>William Stein (<a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.sagemath.org/">http://www.sagemath.org/</a>) built a "front end" system that allows users of many systems to have a common way of communicating. This approach might help with the translation problem.</p>

<p>Of course, there is the issue of "compatible logics" since, as I understand it, a theorem proven in a classical logic is not necessarily a theorem in constructive logic (Bishop?)</p>

<p>If libraries were organized "by the book", it would make it a lot easier to search for theorems. All of the group theory theorems are in the chapter on group theory, for example. That would make it possible to have "library compliance" tests and cross-system proofs.</p>

<p>I don't understand... is the current folder hierarchy in mathlib unclear?</p>
