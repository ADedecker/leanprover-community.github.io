#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577461):
I love that `find` tactic: `#find _ ∈ _::_` got me the desired lemma

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577595):
what is find?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577640):
A command by @**Sebastian Ullrich** . Try `import tactic.find` and then what I wrote

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577653):
still errors

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577658):
what error?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577665):
```lean
import tactic.find

#find _ ∈ _::_ -- command expected

```

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577709):
I think it's a parser error

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577714):
could you show me what worked for you?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577732):
you need something betwenn import and find

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577734):
say `open classical`

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577738):
```lean
import tactic.find

open nat

#find _ ∈ _::_ -- command expected

/-
list.mem_cons_of_mem: ∀ {α : Type u} (y : α) {a : α} {l : list α}, a ∈ l → a ∈ y :: l
list.mem_cons_self: ∀ {α : Type u} (a : α) (l : list α), a ∈ a :: l
-/

ok thanks

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577745):
damnit

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577749):
he didn't fell

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 18:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577750):
:P

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125577754):
That was a clever trap though

#### [Simon Hudon (Apr 23 2018 at 19:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/find/near/125578739):
@**Patrick Massot** You'll have to be sneakier. Maybe try asserting `¬ ¬ P` (e.g. you're not wrong) and watch Kenny assume `P` :D
