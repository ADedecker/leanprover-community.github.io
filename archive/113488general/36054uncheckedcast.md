quite fun

can you cast int to nat?

Lean always has fun trying to do that

oh duh that's exactly what you just did

Is this related to why Lean times out if you try to do this?

I doubt it. I don't think the kernel or the elaborator care about the VM representation.

How come the VM can deal with integers bigger than 2^32 if it is storing things in this classical manner?

looks like `-21474836450` is a natural number!

@**Kevin Buzzard** for small enough integers it stores them in 4-bytes, for bigger ones it uses the GMP multiprecision library

My guess is that a nat is 31 bits for the nat, plus one more bit that says we need more bits. An int is probably `30` bits plus a sign and one more bit for if we need more bits.
```lean
#eval @unchecked_cast nat int (2 ^ 30) -- -1073741824
```

rofl the "need help" bit.

Interesting, it hadn't occurred to me that you could define `unchecked_cast` (in `meta`) yourself, without a special constant.
I wonder how badly you can break things with it. I tried casting a nat to a function nat -> nat and then applying it, hoping for a crash, but all I got was a boring vm check failure.
