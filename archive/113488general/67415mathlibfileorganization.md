For those interested in the file organization of mathlib, I've written up a [proposal](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/148) for a small change that, I think, will improve things a bit. Feedback welcome!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jun 01 2018 at 10:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406319):
Interesting proposal. I have also noticed myself getting lost in the long files...

I would also like to separate the "interface lemma's" from the "real beef", although maybe there is not always a clear line between them.

I'm glad I'm not the only one. I think this is a first logical step to reducing the size of files. There are other steps that can be taken later, of course.

Also, I have never read what the purpose of `default.lean` is. But if I inferred it correctly, then I think we should make more use of it.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jun 01 2018 at 10:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406421):
And then using more files will not increase the length of `import` lines.

I've been deliberately avoiding the use of `default.lean` within mathlib, and I think it's good practice without as well

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Jun 01 2018 at 10:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406464):
AFAIK, the file `data/list/default.lean` allows you to write `import data.list` instead of `import data.list.default`. So, the `default.lean` file generally `import`s everything in the directory.

remember that circular dependencies are bad but there isn't an obvious linear order of files

Right, I had a similar graph on the level of theorems and proofs for my thesis.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jun 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406643):
But why are you scared that the graph becomes to delicate for Lean?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Jun 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406644):
I don't quite see the problem with `default.lean`. Nonetheless, I see it as just an extra and there's no actual need to have one.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jun 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406646):
Well, we need it to keep imports manageable.

Currently, folders are organized by topic, and files are organized by dependency units

so if there is no dependency issue and the topic is still the same, it all goes in one file

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sean Leather (Jun 01 2018 at 10:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406705):
At least with my proposal, once you split a file into one for definitions and one for theorems, the theorems file imports the definitions file, and you just import the theorems file. The `default.lean` just allows you to leave off one part of the hierarchy.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jun 01 2018 at 10:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/mathlib%20file%20organization/near/127406706):

A is used by B, which is used by A'

Ok, and there is a reason (I guess the topic) that B should not be in that file as well.

I've thought many times about separating out definitions. But I'm not sure it's as easy as that

What I really want to know is whether people are, *in general*, in favor of having definitions separated from theorems. From my experience using mathlib, I believe I am. There are certainly wrinkles to be ironed out.

It seems to me that `data/rat.lean` would also benefit from extracting the `def`s.

```
$ grep '^def' data/rat.lean | wc -l
       7
$ grep '^theorem' data/rat.lean | wc -l
      44
$ grep '^instance' data/rat.lean | wc -l
      16
```

 Whether you put instances in with theorems or not is a secondary question. Since I'm not familiar with it, I don't have the answer for you.

(Mario, in my thesis I had one theorem/def per file -- this is all LaTeX --, and it worked quite nicely. I had some LaTeX macros that hyperlinked all references to theorems and definitions. And then with a bit of bash-fu I got PDF's for every theorem/def. I wanted an HTML realisation, but it never became nice enough...)

the downside is that it (apparently) adds a lot of spurious dependencies, more than are truly needed by the theorems

theorems are overrated â @**Kevin Buzzard**

I just read the following blogpost of M. Harris: https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/2018/06/02/is-the-tone-appropriate-is-the-mathematics-at-the-right-level/
It contains the following quote of Scholze:
```quote
âWhat I care most about are definitions. For one thing, humans describe mathematics through language, and, as always, we need sharp words in order to articulate our ideas clearly. (For example, for a long time, I had some idea of the concept of diamonds. But only when I came up with a good name could I really start to think about it, let alone communicate it to others. Finding the name took several months (or even a year?). Then it took another two or three years to finally write down the correct definition (among many close variants). The essential difficulty in writing âEtale cohomology of diamondsâ was (by far) not giving the proofs, but finding the definitions.) But even beyond mere language, we perceive mathematical nature through the lenses given by definitions, and it is critical that the definitions put the essential points into focus.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to find the right definitions by pure thought; one needs to detect the correct problems where progress will require the isolation of a new key concept.â

@**Jeremy Avigad** Thanks for your thoughts.

I agree with you that it is useful to see definitions and theorems together, but I find that most theorems beyond the simplest `rfl` involve more than one definition. Thus, when the definitions are interleaved with large chunks of theorems, I'm either flipping back and forth or viewing different parts of the same file in a split screen. Whereas with all (or as many as is reasonable) of the definitions in one file, I can view two files side-by-side, one with definitions and one with theorems involving those definitions.

To summarize, while I think it would be nice to have a definition with a nearby associated group of theorems, I think that that is already problematic in mathlib in a very practical sense because the number of theorems generally surpasses the number of definitions and makes it difficult to find them. In addition to that, I think definition discovery is a useful part of learning a theory topic and would be aided by putting the definitions in one place.

@**Chris Hughes**: By âdefinition,â are you referring to either (a) the entire declaration (i.e. `def name := term`) or (b) only the name?

(a) While I grant you that we are not engaging in (âfull-blownâ) software engineering when writing mathlib, this is one of those big no-no's in practice. Duplication in comments is notorious for getting out of sync with code. I would strongly recommend against doing this.

(b) Listing the names may provide a minor benefit for reference. But, since theorems generally use the unfolded definition in some form, this won't be helpful when trying to understand a theorem that uses multiple definitions, because you will end up trying to find the declarations themselves. It won't solve the problem I'm trying to solve.

Certainly! My proposal is actually similar to a common pattern in Haskell package development: putting types in a file of their own.

Hi @**Patrick Massot** . I read the thread briefly, so I might have missed the point of the debate. I do not see the advantage of having definitions and theorems in separated files. Sometimes, the difference between a definition and a theorem is quite thin. Also, what makes me believe that an object in the library is what I am looking for is not only its name (and not even only its definition) but also the companion lemmas, examples, etc.  So it would not ease my inspection. Last, the definition of a list in Lean is probably no going to change, but for more complex objects, definitions often evolve during the course of the development. "Testing" the subsequent impact of the changes on notations, lemmas, theorem, etc. is easier if this content is not too far I would say. However, part of the answer might be of a technological nature. Even if I am flatted that people like @**Patrick Massot** want to hear from my experience, you Lean people might benefit from tools that change the game.
