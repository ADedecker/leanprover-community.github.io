As sometimes happens, my goal is currently `FPTB.res BU _ _ s = si i` and my proof that these two things are equal is going to involve showing that they're both the unique object with some property. I am in tactic mode. I need to hence feed both sides into a bunch of machinery (the proofs that each side has the property are quite different). The underscores are proofs. I want to write "now let x be the left hand side" just to make things easier to handle, but the proof terms are probably nightmares. I am hoping there's a cute one-liner which lets me do this, based on the fact that I sometimes use `to_lhs` in conv mode. But I don't think `to_lhs` exists in tactic mode.

It's not a bad idea, but no, `generalize` does not introduce let binders, only regular variables

The best part about `generalize` with `let` is that it doesn't suffer the same problems with type incorrectness as `generalize` itself, since the replacement is definitional

Summary for casual readers: `let x, show x = _` works for me and answers the original question -- it lets `x` be the left hand side of a goal of the form `X = Y`. It looks powerful enough to work in great generality.

fair enough - I forgot that `change` doesn't create metavariables but only unifies. `let x,` has the behavior I intended and also unifies properly in the `show` line, so I guess it's fine

Is there a version of this trick for term mode, when I want to rw something in a hypothesis and not my goal?

You can rw in a hypothesis in term mode by using `eqn â¸ h` in place of `h` wherever it gets used. (You may need `eqn` or `eqn.symm` depending on orientation of the equation.)

Although in the unfolding carefully thread the issue is raised about what happens when conv mode doesn't have the tactics you want.

Maybe you can let `y := RHS`, then rewrite in the hypothesis to get `LHS = y` and then just rw on the hypothesis (`rw ... at H` works)
