<p>As sometimes happens, my goal is currently <code>FPTB.res BU _ _ s = si i</code> and my proof that these two things are equal is going to involve showing that they're both the unique object with some property. I am in tactic mode. I need to hence feed both sides into a bunch of machinery (the proofs that each side has the property are quite different). The underscores are proofs. I want to write "now let x be the left hand side" just to make things easier to handle, but the proof terms are probably nightmares. I am hoping there's a cute one-liner which lets me do this, based on the fact that I sometimes use <code>to_lhs</code> in conv mode. But I don't think <code>to_lhs</code> exists in tactic mode.</p>

<p>can you do the same sort of thing with generalize?</p>

<p>It's not a bad idea, but no, <code>generalize</code> does not introduce let binders, only regular variables</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 07 2018 at 10:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/let%20x%20%3D%20LHS/near/124757008):
<p>The best part about <code>generalize</code> with <code>let</code> is that it doesn't suffer the same problems with type incorrectness as <code>generalize</code> itself, since the replacement is definitional</p>

<p>It works in the sense that no error appears, but all of a sudden I have 4 goals not 1.</p>

<p>This is hardly a serious issue, I mean I could turn proofs on and just copy what it said I guess...</p>

<p>What order are the goals? <code>let x := FPTB.res BU _ _ s, show x = si i</code> should kill most of the auxiliary goals</p>

<p>you should be able to do this by unification, no need to copy down those proofs</p>

<p>I'm sure you are familiar with omitting <code>:=</code> in a <code>have x : property,</code> tactic</p>

<p>Note that this only works in tactic mode, in term mode it's not so flexible</p>

<p>Only thing missing is allowing metavariables instead of <code>_</code> that can be referenced afterwards :)</p>

<p>You can still achieve most of this with unification</p>

<p>Summary for casual readers: <code>let x, show x = _</code> works for me and answers the original question -- it lets <code>x</code> be the left hand side of a goal of the form <code>X = Y</code>. It looks powerful enough to work in great generality.</p>

<p>Do you know why my <code>show let</code> solution failed? Looks like the type checking complained too early</p>

<p>Hmm -- <code>change let x := _ in x = si i</code> actually gives <code> don't know how to synthesize placeholder; context = blah blah blah, â¢ ?m_1</code></p>

<p>I think <code>let</code> checking the value independent from the body is a feature</p>

<p>fair enough - I forgot that <code>change</code> doesn't create metavariables but only unifies. <code>let x,</code> has the behavior I intended and also unifies properly in the <code>show</code> line, so I guess it's fine</p>

<p>Is there a version of this trick for term mode, when I want to rw something in a hypothesis and not my goal?</p>

<p>You can rw in a hypothesis in term mode by using <code>eqn â¸ h</code> in place of <code>h</code> wherever it gets used. (You may need <code>eqn</code> or <code>eqn.symm</code> depending on orientation of the equation.)</p>

<p>This came up with me specifically because I could not use rw because I only wanted to rewrite a certain term on the LHS, and it showed up on both sides.</p>

<p>Maybe you can let <code>y := RHS</code>, then rewrite in the hypothesis to get <code>LHS = y</code> and then just rw on the hypothesis (<code>rw ... at H</code> works)</p>
