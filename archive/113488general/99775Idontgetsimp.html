<p>I have been doing a lot of mathematics in Lean recently -- not plumbing, but high-level stuff, API-making. I never tag anything with <code>simp</code> though, because I don't know how <code>simp</code> works. My favourite tactic is rfl and a lot of my proofs are of the form <code>rw [A,B,C], show X, rw [D,E,F], show Y, rwa [G,H]</code>. I have no feeling as to whether <code>G</code> and <code>H</code> should be <code>simp</code> lemmas, or even if the assertion that <code>Y</code> is equal to the thing I changed into <code>Y</code> with the <code>show</code> command should be a simp lemma, even though the proof is <code>rfl</code>.</p>
<p>Yesterday Patrick was frustrated because some complete triviality which to a mathematician's eyes looks like the statement <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/x = 1/x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">1</span><span class="mord mathrm">/</span><span class="mord mathit">x</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord mathrm">1</span><span class="mord mathrm">/</span><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> could not be proved with refl or simp, so he formalised a statement which would suffice for his purposes and asked me if I could prove it for him (because like doing these little puzzles and Patrick has no time for them).</p>

<p>I tried <code>simp</code> and it didn't work, so I opened up the division ring API and had a look. Note that I say this, but there is no division ring API really, there are a bunch of lemmas which might be in the division ring namespace, or might ask for division ring instances using type class inference, or they might be in completely different namespaces like the semiring namespace but they apply to division rings anyway even though this is not explicitly noted in mathlib (should it be?) and they're scattered around, but I know my way around now. A mathematician-sanitised version of  <code>#print prefix division_ring</code> would be really nice, we don't care much about recursors and assertions about size_of, we just want to see universal properties and basic lemmas. What I guess I would like to have access to is some sort of "mathematician's API for division rings in Lean", where we get to see once and for all what we are supposed to be using. I would also need a "mathematician's API for units of a ring in Lean" I think -- but once I have these, will I see <code>x.inv</code> in them? This could also be written as <code>((x⁻¹ : units α) : α)</code>. Is this somehow the "correct" way to access the <code>inv</code> field for a unit?</p>
<p>Here is my proposed proof of Patrick's lemma. </p>

<p>I can't get <code>simp</code> to work. I am unclear about whether we should need the lemma at all. How does all this work? Not understanding how to use <code>simp</code> properly in my own API's is bad; I would like to learn how to write better API's. Are there rules saying what should and should not go into a <code>simp</code> lemma? How come I can prove <code>units.coe_inv'</code> using <code>simp</code> but I can't prove the lemma in the form Patrick gave to me using <code>simp</code>? How do I make <code>simp</code> work better for me?</p>

<p><code>simp</code> lemmas will trigger on a syntactic match, so if one hasn't been careful with sticking to a canonical form, a <code>change</code> is sometimes required:</p>

<p>i'm not sure if it would be feasible to try to have <code>simp</code> lemmas trigger on successful unification instead of a syntactic match. it would make <code>simp</code> a lot slower, and for definitionally-provable <code>simp</code> lemmas it would naiively just try them over and over again.</p>
<p>maybe a tactic which just attempts to rewrite subterms to all the definitionally equal things it can think of would be useful for these kinds of situations. (we should call it <code>dblast</code>)</p>

<p>Well I didn't write division rings and I didn't write units. How do I find out the canonical form of <code>(x : α)⁻¹ = x.inv</code>?</p>

<p>the convention is set by whoever wrote the library (like how mathlib prefers <code>le</code> over <code>ge</code>, so that <code>ge</code> goals must be <code>change</code>d to <code>le</code> before <code>simp</code> will work, or how <code>finset.to_set</code> is superceded by the uparrow coercion notation in most lemmas). i think for now one has to just poke around in the library and look at the simp lemmas to see what the conventions are.</p>

<p>I see, so there is no formal place to read the canonical notation? And is it always there, or sometimes do different people use different competing canonical notation?</p>

<p>maybe it wouldn't be hard to write a tool which checks what the preferred definitionally-equivalent version of a given term is in the imported libraries. but right now, i think the task of ensuring uniform conventions falls to the <code>mathlib</code> maintainers.</p>
<p>sometimes, if you aren't careful in writing a library, you find yourself with two different families of <code>simp</code> lemmas with different conventions, and then things become very unpleasant (this has happened to me)</p>
