<p>I'm watching Buchholtz's talk at the CMU conference. From what I've studied about Cubical Type Theory I'm kinda confused.</p>
<p>1) From topology, a cube is isomorphic to a sphere<br>
2) a cubical type can be mapped to a sphere where one corner is at the 'north' pole <br>
3) a cubical type defines maps and their inverses for each corner.<br>
4) start at the 'north' pole corner, walk a face forward, composing the forward maps.<br>
5) after traversing one face (4 compositions) you end up at the 'north' pole again<br>
6) start at the 'north' pole corner, walk a face backward, composing the inverse maps.<br>
7) after traversing the same face (4 compositions) you end up at the 'north' pole again<br>
8) so the forward and inverse functions collapse into the identity function on the 'north' pole point.<br>
9) collapse the face into the identity function<br>
10) iterate the above for every face<br>
11) therefore, the cube is just the identity function</p>
<p>Clearly I'm confused because, in the course I took on Cubical Type Theory, nobody seemed to<br>
view the cube as collapsing to the identity function. <br>
Which step of reasoning is wrong?</p>

<p><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory" target="_blank" title="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory">Cubical type theory</a> is an extension of Martin LÃ¶f Type theory.  It adds more rules which allow one to prove certain things are equal.  It lets you prove the univalence axiom (in a constructive way) in Homotopy type theory.  The name "cubical" comes from the concept of "cubical sets".  <del>I don't know what you mean by "Cubical type" in (2), but I think you are talking about something different.  Cubical Type Theory is also a fairly recent invention, so I don't think you took a course on it, or if you did it was a different subject by the same name.</del></p>

<p>Sorry.  I think I was mistaken.  Forget everything I just said.</p>
