<p>I'm going to try out this streaming thing: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit/" target="_blank" title="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit/">https://www.twitch.tv/colimit/</a><br>
No audio or webcam for now, sorry.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> you mentioned that you wanted to see Lean in emacs--unfortunately my laptop wasn't working while I was in Paris, but maybe this is the next best thing</p>

<p>Unfortunately I need to run. Can I watch it later or is it only live?</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 08 2018 at 15:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133567863):
<p>Hmm, I don't have a setup for recording right now, but I will probably do more later</p>

<p>I thought that twitch recorded stuff automatically (if you ask them to) and then leave it around for others to watch later on.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 08 2018 at 18:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133573331):
<p>Oh thanks, I found the checkbox. Not sure whether it will affect the current stream</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 17:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133615685):
<p>Okay, trying this again (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit" target="_blank" title="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit">https://www.twitch.tv/colimit</a>). I think Twitch will save a video this time.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 09 2018 at 20:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620550):
<p>I'm watching, but it's hard to follow without knowing what you are proving.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 09 2018 at 20:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620600):
<p>But I like seeing that right panel saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sign up to experience the best of colimit:<br>
* Chat with other fans<br>
* Capture your favorite moments<br>
* Watch in Dark Mode!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's slightly weird</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I am deep in the middle of something now: proving that a filtered category has a cofinal functor from a directed poset.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 20:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620925):
<p>Actually, I just realized I don't understand the proof I thought I was formalizing</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133621338):
<p>If you have a copy of Locally Presentable and Accessible categories, you can follow along on page 14, except the proof there is not quite right</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 15:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730880):
<p>More at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit" target="_blank" title="https://www.twitch.tv/colimit">https://www.twitch.tv/colimit</a> -- let me know if these announcements become annoying...</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730919):
<p>it isn't annoying at all, don't worry</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730923):
<p>i'm your fan :P</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730937):
<p>though I would certainly enjoy it more if you spoke</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133731099):
<p>Yeah, I should try to find some solution for that eventually.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 11 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133731109):
<p>I am tempted to do it too, I figured there was no reason not to stream every time I worked on Lean, but actually the only time I will have to work on Lean today will be when I'm on the tube and then internet connection just goes on and off constantly (on &lt;-&gt; in a station).</p>

<p>Yes I hope you find a chance to do so!</p>
