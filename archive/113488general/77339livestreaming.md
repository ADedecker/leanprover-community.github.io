I'm going to try out this streaming thing: https://www.twitch.tv/colimit/
No audio or webcam for now, sorry.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 08 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133567693):
@**Patrick Massot** you mentioned that you wanted to see Lean in emacs--unfortunately my laptop wasn't working while I was in Paris, but maybe this is the next best thing

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 08 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133567807):
Unfortunately I need to run. Can I watch it later or is it only live?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 08 2018 at 15:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133567863):
Hmm, I don't have a setup for recording right now, but I will probably do more later

I thought that twitch recorded stuff automatically (if you ask them to) and then leave it around for others to watch later on.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 08 2018 at 18:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133573331):
Oh thanks, I found the checkbox. Not sure whether it will affect the current stream

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 17:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133615685):
Okay, trying this again (https://www.twitch.tv/colimit). I think Twitch will save a video this time.

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 09 2018 at 20:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620550):
I'm watching, but it's hard to follow without knowing what you are proving.

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 09 2018 at 20:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620600):
But I like seeing that right panel saying: 
> Sign up to experience the best of colimit:
> * Chat with other fans
> * Capture your favorite moments
> * Watch in Dark Mode!"

It's slightly weird

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 20:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620921):
Oh yeah, I am deep in the middle of something now: proving that a filtered category has a cofinal functor from a directed poset.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 20:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133620925):
Actually, I just realized I don't understand the proof I thought I was formalizing

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133621338):
If you have a copy of Locally Presentable and Accessible categories, you can follow along on page 14, except the proof there is not quite right

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 15:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730880):
More at https://www.twitch.tv/colimit -- let me know if these announcements become annoying...

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730919):
it isn't annoying at all, don't worry

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730923):
i'm your fan :P

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133730937):
though I would certainly enjoy it more if you spoke

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133731099):
Yeah, I should try to find some solution for that eventually.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 11 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133731109):
I am tempted to do it too, I figured there was no reason not to stream every time I worked on Lean, but actually the only time I will have to work on Lean today will be when I'm on the tube and then internet connection just goes on and off constantly (on <-> in a station).

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 11 2018 at 15:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/live%20streaming/near/133731159):
Yes I hope you find a chance to do so!
