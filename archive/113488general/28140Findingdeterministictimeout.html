<p>I made a change that created a (deterministic) timeout in PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1319" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1319">#1319</a>. Lean is not very good reporting this error message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travis failed with the error <code>/home/travis/scripts/travis_long: fork: Cannot allocate memory</code>. This was almost certainly because it ran across the timeout</li>
<li>When running <code>lean --make src/</code> the deterministic timeout failed silently. The first error message I received was in a file <em>importing</em> the file with the deterministic timeout (it did not create a <code>.olean</code> file for the file with the timeout).</li>
<li>Suppose <code>A.lean</code> has a deterministic timeout and you open <code>B.lean</code> in VSCode. <code>B.lean</code> does not raise any errors, not even <code>imported file uses sorry</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This made it tricky to find the file with the deterministic timeout. This post is mostly a cautionary tale. But if anyone knows a good way to find which file has the timeout, I'm happy to hear it. (on Windows <code>lean</code> doesn't report which file it is currently compiling, that might help)</p>

<p>Using a Makefile to build mathlib might help</p>

<p>I have a Makefile for it somewhere on my drive</p>
