<p>I mentioned on the chat earlier today that I was going to have a day off work, but I didn't say why. I am 50 today (I have been for ten minutes in fact), which some people think is a big deal. I've spent so much time over the last few months just doing basic number theory / topology with random undergraduates many of whom do not even speak on this forum, I've had a really good time, it's meant that I've got behind on so many things but honestly Lean has changed my life for the better and I'm so pleased to be involved. Oh wow so much stuff I didn't know about!</p>

<p>I would never dream of hurrying you. Sometimes people have to wait. Patrick really wants perfectoids done but I was talking to Chris over lunch and confessing that I was skipping lemmas about valuations because even though they "should be there", I wasn't going to put them there until we needed them. Chris said that this wasn't really the way to write Lean code. But if I write it properly Patrick will have to wait even longer. That's why ultimately I decided to start at the top to find out how many sorrys there are. Maybe I can even estimate how much work is left, in some sense. But as you once said, it's an open source project, people work on it when they can.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is an example of how it's tricky to say exactly what it means to define something. What Hales has done here is define a function <code>ζ</code> which, "externally", we can prove is equal to the usual zeta function.<br>
Actually he only did this assuming a couple axioms, but the axioms are easy to avoid--just define <code>ζ</code> in terms of the axioms if they are true, and define it to be 37 if they are false.<br>
This sort of thing already happened implicitly where he defined <code>exp</code> as a <code>tsum</code> and <code>real.log</code> as a <code>sup</code>--there are side conditions that you need here to make sure that you defined what you expected to define.</p>

<p>So the first goal is to give a sorry-free definition of an explicit function from C -&gt; C which away from s = 1 agrees with the Riemann zeta function, possibly after invoking known mathematical theorems. Can we make it computable?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Wow, I think the response to your mathoverflow post is really positive! I expected a lot (a lot!) more skepticism from the community. Maybe mathoverflow isn't completely representative. But still, I really like this. Apart from the thing about Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory all the other proposals are actually nice (somewhat ambitious) and realisable.</p>

<p>Johan I would like to personally thank you for your idea about pi, and also Patrick for your suggestion about the T_2 project. I am still really flattered and stunned, and really touched. I think everyone should try to formalise one of their theorems. I don't understand formal abstracts. Are they waiting for Lean 4 or what? I don't have any unrealistic ambitions. I'm not thinking that in 1 year we will have Lean 4 with the global Langlands conjectures. But all this internet noise I'm trying to make today is because I want to train mathematicians <em>right now</em>, so we are ready to deal with what what might be the huge task of porting Mathlib to Lean 4. Johannes is leaving academia and Mario cannot do it alone. We need more volunteers and they need training. We have now seen that it takes one year to turn an incoming first year undergraduate into Chris Hughes or Kenny Lau. Let's make a few more of them with Lean 3.4.2 and worry about Lean 4 later. Let's see what we can do with a first year PhD student. There are plenty of other things to worry about before Lean 4. For example categories and canonical isomorphisms / transport de structure. Lean 4 is not magically going to solve those, or at least I don't think it is.</p>

<p>My pleasure! It was a lot of fun to work on these projects behind your back. But really <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> deserves an insane amount of credit. He did all the hard work on <code>exp</code> and <code>pi</code> all by himself.</p>

<p>well that was eventful. Thank you all for the encouragement. If anyone wants to write a guest blog post just ask.</p>

<p>Woo, Kevin's MO question just hit the HNQ list, which means it will be seen across all of stack overflow</p>

<p>Let's see what happens...</p>

<p>"Locally presentable categories and combinatorial model categories please. Is it feasible ? I am actually discovering this thread and know nothing about Lean." says someone on the MO question, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> ?</p>

<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> was talking about similar stuff in Orsay. This shouldn't be too far.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wrote about half of a detailed outline for model categories.<br>
Actually I wrote all of the parts up through constructing combinatorial model categories if you don't want any examples <span class="emoji emoji-263a" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
