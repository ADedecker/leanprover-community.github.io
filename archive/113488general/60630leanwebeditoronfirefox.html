's a proof that (2 : \R) + 2 = 4 in the Lean Web Editor. You can check it's working by clicking in between two of the characters in <code>norm_num</code>, where you should see "2 + 2 = 4" as the goal on the right hand side. </p>
<p>Works fine for me in Chrome, doesn't work for me in firefox (firefox quantum 65.0, 64 bit, I tried Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS).</p>
<p>I've been asked to give a talk about my teaching at some internal teaching thing and they want me to do "15 minutes of interactive Lean" with people who aren't mathematicians but are scientists. Apparently they will be told to bring their laptops. I don't fancy my chances getting it installed so it will have to be Lean Web Editor but I've had real problems with it on firefox recently.</p>
