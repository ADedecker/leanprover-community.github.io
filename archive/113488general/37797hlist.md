Does anyone know if we have heterogenous lists (hlist) somewhere in mathlib?

is that just `list Σ T : Type u, T`?

I want to be able to specify the types:

so if I have `T : list (Type u)`, I want `hlist T`

with length the same at T, and the i-th element has type the i-th element of T.

`{L : list (Σ T : Type u, T) // L.map sigma.fst =T}`

what are the lemmas that you want to prove regarding hlist?

I've definitely seen them somewhere.... sorry

Ugh, what's the trick for matching on fin n?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001405):
(Thanks, Chris, for your suggestion. I agree that would have worked; but I decided to just use dependent functions on fin n for now.)

I've got a `n : fin 2` and want to write `match n with | \< 0, _ \> := ... | \<1, _\> := ... end`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001573):
but this isn't exhaustive

how about fin.succ_rec_on

I certainly have a definition of `hlist` sitting around somewhere, but I never managed to get it mathlib ready

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Sep 15 2018 at 10:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134002166):
I pushed to a `hlist` branch on community mathlib: https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/b5d6d6

I want to be clear that I'm not really advocating this representation, this is more of an experiment. It also doesn't completely compile since the top half of the file was rewritten more than the bottom
