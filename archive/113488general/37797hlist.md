#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000255):
<p>Does anyone know if we have heterogenous lists (hlist) somewhere in mathlib?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 15 2018 at 09:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000304):
<p>is that just <code>list Σ T : Type u, T</code>?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000319):
<p>I want to be able to specify the types:</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000326):
<p>so if I have <code>T : list (Type u)</code>, I want <code>hlist T</code></p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000365):
<p>with length the same at T, and the i-th element has type the i-th element of T.</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Sep 15 2018 at 09:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000631):
<p><code>{L : list (Σ T : Type u, T) // L.map sigma.fst =T}</code></p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 15 2018 at 09:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000679):
<p>what are the lemmas that you want to prove regarding hlist?</p>

#### [ Keeley Hoek (Sep 15 2018 at 09:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134000960):
<p>I've definitely seen them somewhere.... sorry</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001356):
<p>Ugh, what's the trick for matching on fin n?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001405):
<p>(Thanks, Chris, for your suggestion. I agree that would have worked; but I decided to just use dependent functions on fin n for now.)</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001572):
<p>I've got a <code>n : fin 2</code> and want to write <code>match n with | \&lt; 0, _ \&gt; := ... | \&lt;1, _\&gt; := ... end</code></p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 15 2018 at 09:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001573):
<p>but this isn't exhaustive</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 15 2018 at 09:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001808):
<p>how about fin.succ_rec_on</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 15 2018 at 10:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134001921):
<p>I certainly have a definition of <code>hlist</code> sitting around somewhere, but I never managed to get it mathlib ready</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 15 2018 at 10:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134002166):
<p>I pushed to a <code>hlist</code> branch on community mathlib: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/b5d6d6" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/b5d6d6">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/b5d6d6</a></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 15 2018 at 10:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hlist/near/134002208):
<p>I want to be clear that I'm not really advocating this representation, this is more of an experiment. It also doesn't completely compile since the top half of the file was rewritten more than the bottom</p>
