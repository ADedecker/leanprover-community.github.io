This definition (from `library/init/data/punit.lean`) is less general than probably intended because `()` is (apparently) built-in notation for `unit.star` only, and so the full inferred type is actually `punit_eq_punit : âˆ€ (a : punit.{1}), @eq.{1} punit.{1} a unit.star`.
```lean
lemma punit_eq_punit (a : punit) : a = () :=
punit_eq a ()
```
Since this is in the core Lean library, is there any hope to change it?

Someone should really read that Zulip bot documentation. Programming a bot to detect this question and answer "no" is probably a nice exercise then.
