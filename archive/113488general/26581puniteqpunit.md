<p>This definition (from <code>library/init/data/punit.lean</code>) is less general than probably intended because <code>()</code> is (apparently) built-in notation for <code>unit.star</code> only, and so the full inferred type is actually <code>punit_eq_punit : âˆ€ (a : punit.{1}), @eq.{1} punit.{1} a unit.star</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">lemma</span> <span class="n">punit_eq_punit</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">punit</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="n">punit_eq</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Since this is in the core Lean library, is there any hope to change it?</p>

<p>Someone should really read that Zulip bot documentation. Programming a bot to detect this question and answer "no" is probably a nice exercise then.</p>
