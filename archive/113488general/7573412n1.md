As Scott mentioned elsewhere, I had some difficulty defining the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} : `finset pnat`. I ended up using recursion--thanks Chris for providing the magical last line.
```lean
--- The set {1, 2, ..., n-1}
def my_range : ℕ+ → multiset ℕ+
| ⟨0, h⟩ := absurd h dec_trivial
| ⟨1, _⟩ := ∅
| ⟨(n+1)+1, _⟩ := ⟨n+1, succ_pos n⟩ :: my_range ⟨n+1, succ_pos n⟩
using_well_founded { rel_tac := λ _ _, `[exact ⟨_, measure_wf subtype.val⟩] }
```
I know `multiset` is not `finset`--using `multiset` made things a bit easier later because I wanted to subtract a sum over {1, 2, ..., n-1} from the same sum over {1, 2, ..., n} and this way I didn't have to prove that the element n is not in the former set. But I guess if I could define {1, 2, ..., n-1} in terms of stuff that's already in mathlib then checking that last side condition would also have been easy.

Any suggestions?
I think I could have used `finset.range`, `finset.filter`, `finset.attach`, and `finset.map`, but that also sounded a bit awkward.

I had to do something similar once, and I used `(finset.range n).erase 0`. I really should be defined though. We have `range'` on lists, perhaps it should be extended to finsets.

The extra complication here is that I need a `finset pnat`

Not a `finset nat`

Haskell has an `Enum` class, maybe we could adapt it...

mathlib has `fintype` and `countable` which you may be able to use for this purpose

I'm not sure it is good to rely on what the `countable` instance is. But the underlying idea is good. Namely, I could start with `range (n-1) : finset nat` and then `finset.map` the function which takes `n : nat` to `n+1 : pnat`

That's much simpler than the roundabout way I suggested earlier.

what about changing range to `range : nat -> nat -> finset nat`?  With `range n m = {n, ..., m - 1}` or `range n m = {m + 1, ..., n}` if `m < n`

or adding an `interval` for this

I think you're right. We need to assume a linear order on the elements. Maybe mapping the elements to integers would be better though.

I would suggest using `finset.map succ_pnat (finset.range n.pred)`

Because computers were less prevalent when I was younger, I had done a lot of mathematics on paper before I seriously engaged with mathematical software. I remember being very surprised by this computer science idea of starting at 0 instead of 1, and for some time I would keep track of where I was summing from and whether it would be easier to start at 0 or 1 (in the sense that e.g. the indices are simpler if you make one choice over the other). In computer-sciency things it seems to me that 0 is often a good choice, but in maths the positive naturals do play an important role, and it is not uncommon that starting to sum at 1 is a natural thing to do.

I still have a very poor understanding of why the following is not what is done: define pnat to be an inductive type with two constructors `one` and `succ`, write a tactic which proves everything about `pnat` from the corresponding statements for `nat` and then perhaps with a little human help prove the important things about prange(n)={1,2,...,n}.

one downside of that is that `pnat` would certainly be much bigger this way

Does that matter? Give it a coercion to nat, prove the lemmas, forget about it.

You could say the same the other way around. To prove a type is inductive with some constructors you prove an appropriate `rec_on` theorem

Fair point. I will need to think harder about why I was at some point concerned that pnat was "only" a subtype and see if any of my reasons make any sense in the cold light of day.

I was surprised to see that there was no `pnat.rec_on` yet, which made my recursive definition more complicated than expected. I failed to make a note of that so it's good that that came up again.

Just to clarify, in the particular case of the IMO problem I'm solving, there's no technical reason whatsoever that I couldn't just reindex things starting at 0--the only purpose I have for not doing that is to see what are the little issues like this which crop up when starting from 1. (And the problem does *say* "a_1, a_2, ...".)
