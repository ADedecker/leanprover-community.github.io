<p>As Scott mentioned elsewhere, I had some difficulty defining the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} : <code>finset pnat</code>. I ended up using recursion--thanks Chris for providing the magical last line.</p>

<p>I know <code>multiset</code> is not <code>finset</code>--using <code>multiset</code> made things a bit easier later because I wanted to subtract a sum over {1, 2, ..., n-1} from the same sum over {1, 2, ..., n} and this way I didn't have to prove that the element n is not in the former set. But I guess if I could define {1, 2, ..., n-1} in terms of stuff that's already in mathlib then checking that last side condition would also have been easy.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?<br>
I think I could have used <code>finset.range</code>, <code>finset.filter</code>, <code>finset.attach</code>, and <code>finset.map</code>, but that also sounded a bit awkward.</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Sep 24 2018 at 18:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134536670):
<p>I had to do something similar once, and I used <code>(finset.range n).erase 0</code>. I really should be defined though. We have <code>range'</code> on lists, perhaps it should be extended to finsets.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 24 2018 at 18:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134536735):
<p>The extra complication here is that I need a <code>finset pnat</code></p>

<p>Not a <code>finset nat</code></p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 24 2018 at 18:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134536767):
<p>Haskell has an <code>Enum</code> class, maybe we could adapt it...</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 24 2018 at 19:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134539021):
<p>mathlib has <code>fintype</code> and <code>countable</code> which you may be able to use for this purpose</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 24 2018 at 19:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134539480):
<p>I'm not sure it is good to rely on what the <code>countable</code> instance is. But the underlying idea is good. Namely, I could start with <code>range (n-1) : finset nat</code> and then <code>finset.map</code> the function which takes <code>n : nat</code> to <code>n+1 : pnat</code></p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 24 2018 at 19:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134539489):
<p>That's much simpler than the roundabout way I suggested earlier.</p>

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 24 2018 at 19:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134539635):
<p>what about changing range to <code>range : nat -&gt; nat -&gt; finset nat</code>?  With <code>range n m = {n, ..., m - 1}</code> or <code>range n m = {m + 1, ..., n}</code> if <code>m &lt; n</code></p>

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 24 2018 at 19:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134539649):
<p>or adding an <code>interval</code> for this</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 24 2018 at 19:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134541041):
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you're right. We need to assume a linear order on the elements. Maybe mapping the elements to integers would be better though.</p>

<p>I would suggest using <code>finset.map succ_pnat (finset.range n.pred)</code></p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 25 2018 at 09:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134579309):
<p>Because computers were less prevalent when I was younger, I had done a lot of mathematics on paper before I seriously engaged with mathematical software. I remember being very surprised by this computer science idea of starting at 0 instead of 1, and for some time I would keep track of where I was summing from and whether it would be easier to start at 0 or 1 (in the sense that e.g. the indices are simpler if you make one choice over the other). In computer-sciency things it seems to me that 0 is often a good choice, but in maths the positive naturals do play an important role, and it is not uncommon that starting to sum at 1 is a natural thing to do.</p>
<p>I still have a very poor understanding of why the following is not what is done: define pnat to be an inductive type with two constructors <code>one</code> and <code>succ</code>, write a tactic which proves everything about <code>pnat</code> from the corresponding statements for <code>nat</code> and then perhaps with a little human help prove the important things about prange(n)={1,2,...,n}.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 25 2018 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134579385):
<p>one downside of that is that <code>pnat</code> would certainly be much bigger this way</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 25 2018 at 09:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134579676):
<p>Does that matter? Give it a coercion to nat, prove the lemmas, forget about it.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 25 2018 at 09:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134579794):
<p>You could say the same the other way around. To prove a type is inductive with some constructors you prove an appropriate <code>rec_on</code> theorem</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 25 2018 at 09:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134579923):
<p>Fair point. I will need to think harder about why I was at some point concerned that pnat was "only" a subtype and see if any of my reasons make any sense in the cold light of day.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 25 2018 at 13:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134589702):
<p>I was surprised to see that there was no <code>pnat.rec_on</code> yet, which made my recursive definition more complicated than expected. I failed to make a note of that so it's good that that came up again.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 25 2018 at 13:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/%7B1%2C%202%2C%20...%2C%20n-1%7D/near/134589746):
<p>Just to clarify, in the particular case of the IMO problem I'm solving, there's no technical reason whatsoever that I couldn't just reindex things starting at 0--the only purpose I have for not doing that is to see what are the little issues like this which crop up when starting from 1. (And the problem does <em>say</em> "a_1, a_2, ...".)</p>
