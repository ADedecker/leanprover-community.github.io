<p>(<a href="https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/01/29/mechanized-proofs-for-pl-past-present-and-future" target="_blank" title="https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/01/29/mechanized-proofs-for-pl-past-present-and-future">https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/01/29/mechanized-proofs-for-pl-past-present-and-future</a>) POPLmark challenge is about Mechanized Proofs for Programming Languages. Lean is not just about mechanizing formal mathematics. It is also about mechanizing computational mathematics (at least from my opinionated viewpoint).   So besides pushing into the Math dept. we need to push into CS departments.</p>

<p>From the talk... The paper abstract reads:<br>
How close are we to a world where every paper on progamming languages is accompanied by an electronic appendix with machine-checked proofs?<br>
We propose an initial set of benchmarks for measuring progress in this area. Based on the metatheory of System $F_&lt;$, a typed lambda-calculus with second-order polymorphism, subtyping, and records, these benchmarks embody many aspects of programming languages that are challenging to formalize: variable binding at both the term and type levels, syntactic forms with variable numbers of components (including binders), and proofs demanding complex induction principles. We hopt that these benchmarks will help clarify the current state of the art, provide a basis for comparing competing technologies, and motivate further research.</p>

<p>One of the likely side-effects of a proglib (vs mathlib) would be developing program generation from Lean proofs. This isn't of much interest to the formal math approach but would be to the computational math crowd (aka me :-) )</p>

<p>I don't want to minimize Kevin's work, but it looks like this forum gives you a very distorted view of the reality of maths departments. To finite order, nothing changed. Any effect is beyond what Taylor expansions can see. The number of mathematicians using a proof assistant may have been multiplied by 20 in the last two years, but it is still very very very close to zero in proportion.</p>

<p>I did a survey of the connection between ITP and Computer Algebra. I can only name one person (James Davenport) who appears in both bibliographies. So I know that this is at the "not even noise" level. But I have a "30 Year Horizon" view and I believe the connection must arrive in the long term. In particular, the subset of programming that involves computer algebra seems most likely to be automated since the specifications of the algorithms are already (reasonably well) known.</p>
<p>I'm spending the evening digging up information on TWELF and Standard ML, looking for something that could serve as a kernel of "proglib" in Lean. If Lean could produce ML programs from proofs that would be a major advance for Lean.</p>
<p>The fact that nobody knows how to do this is what makes it research.</p>

<p>Yes. Lean should be able to extract a program from a proof. I'd rather it could extract SPAD (Axiom's language) programs as SPAD is dependently typed but ML might be easier as some of the other systems could provide validation.</p>

<p>One interesting thought would be to try to build 'proglib' so that everything has a programming language representation. Sort of "designed to be executed". I'm not sure yet how this can be done, of course.</p>

<p>In Lean 4, this will sometimes even be a sensible thing to do. But a lot depends on the original proof. For example, if it is nonconstructive, then it has no computational meaning.</p>

<p>If you want to write verified programs, why consider them as proofs and not as normal values? This way you can write programs in a readable way, and prove properties about them separately (which is done in CFML, CompCert, etc. afaik)</p>

<p>My thought (and what I'm using as a basis for reading) is that I'm looking for a translation from program -&gt; Lean -&gt; program that is 1-1 (or some near approach). I've found some ML and TWELF papers so I'm reading.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132878">@Simon Cruanes</span>  I have programs written in a reasonable way (e.g. GCD, Groebner, etc) and specifications for them. But there needs to be some deeper, automated connection from these programs to Lean and back so they can be trusted. Otherwise it feels like "hand waving" (at least to me).</p>

<p>There is an interesting split I've come to recognize between the ITP approach and the Type-Theory approach to things, despite the fact that they both seem to use the same judgments. ITP systems tend toward "tactics" whereas the Type-Theory approach tends to use unification.</p>

<p>In my (limited) view of the field, it seems like most big programs that are verified in ITPs are all based on the separation of the program to prove and the properties on the program (even CompCert, and of course, SEL4, CakeML, etc.).<br>
I'm not aware of any actual big program written as a proof following the CH correspondence. I'd love be to proven wrong though!</p>

<p>Axiom is a collection of mathematical algorithms. Rather than prove a large program, my effort is to prove the individual algorithms. So, for instance, GCD has a specification and an implementation. There are several interesting questions that arise. Axiom actually has 22 different GCD algorithms (e.g. GCD for polynomials, Nats, etc). How can these algorithms be proven correct. How can they be proven correct in such a way that Lean can verify the proof, allowing Lean to use Axiom as an Oracle for a GCD computation.</p>

<p>Nat in Axiom is called NonNegativeInteger (NNI). The definitions, axioms, and theorems available to the NNI Domain (an Axiom term for an implementation) are all inherited. The NNI Domain also includes a "carrier" (called a REP) which specifies how elements are implemented. So, given group theory axioms (e.g. associativity), a representation, a specification, and an algorithm... use Lean's group theory and Nat, as well as pre- and post-conditions and loop invariants to prove the GCD correct in Lean.</p>

<p>In an ideal world a GCD algorithm would be transformed into a Lean proof object, proven, and then re-generated from the proof object. The proof then becomes a certificate you can hand to a proof-checker.</p>

<p>I think since Lean already has decent category theory support it would make sense to formalize the categorical view of programming languages (at least Haskell folks seem to be interested in that). I have an 80%-finished experiment showing that SystemFw types form a category on my hard drive.. but to really draw attention it would probably need to formalize something like lenses which requires both type theory work (like a type inference so one can avoid invoking the axioms everywhere) and more category theory than mathlib currently has (mostly profunctors and (co)ends)</p>

<p>I'm not sure the categorical view espoused by Haskellites is actually coherent, compelling though it is.

<p>I haven't finished my project yet, so I can't be 100% sure that it works, but I would be surprised if it didn't.. Mostly because SystemFw isn't Haskell and doesn't have laziness or infinite loops. I agree that most Haskellers use category theory a bit loosely, but then it actually makes some sense to assume that a Haskell program doesn't contain bottom since if it did it wouldn't run/finish :)</p>

<p>haskell programs often contain bottom in places other than where the program actually goes. It seems difficult to me to deliver a denotational semantics for lazy haskell programs that does not contain bottom</p>

<p>Yeah, that's true. And even when you make extra sure to only write halting functions you still have stuff like 'head' in the Prelude :( But still, if the goal is to "buzzard" Haskellers, category theory could be a good choice.</p>

<p>A reasonably sound start for a 'proglib' would be to look at The (Revised) Definition of Standard ML (<a href="http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf">http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf</a>).  Constructed properly, it should be possible to write in ML, grind it into a proof expression, and output ML. Since ML has a full formal definition this should cover a reasonable range of "proofs with execution semantics".</p>

<p>I'm attracted to ML as an initial basis for a 'proglib' for several reasons. (1) it has an ITP history, (2) it has a semantics definition, (3) it has been used as a programming language for other things, (4) it is sort-of implemented in other ITP systems and OCaml. </p>
<p>My problem with it is that while functions are first class, types are not. Axiom has first class dependent types so it isn't quite the full basis I need but it is pretty close and, honestly, will keep me busy for a long time anyway :-)</p>

<p>I'm only going after specification and proofs of mathematical algorithms. They already work but are not yet proven in Lean so Lean cannot use them as Oracles. So 'proglib' would not be a naive approach as the algorithms already exist. Nor would it be a Smart way as the goal is not "all" programming language, just one that is a respected implementation of computational mathematics. 'Proglib' would provide a way to communicate soundly and with execution semantics (lacking in a lot of proofs I've looked at so far).</p>
<p>Axiom is the result of an estimated 42 million dollars and 300+ person years of work, some of it as PhD research. We don't have the funding or organization to repeat the effort from scratch. However, putting Axiom on a formal footing is possible but it requires automation and intimate interaction between Lean and Axiom. It is not a question of (Naive) accepting algorithms generated from Lean. It is a question of constructing a sound basis for cooperation.</p>

<p>I am by no means an expert in this sort of thing, but I know for sure that Leo is targetting computer scientists with Lean 4.</p>

<p>The computer scientist camp (of which I'm one) tends to do Type Checking, Unification (ala prolog), and forward/backward typing. There is the idea of "judgments-as-type", which I don't see in the ITP literature. Ideas are expressed as code.</p>
<p>Having spent the last few years wandering in the ITP side I see mathematical notation. (I really wish <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> "natural language idea would catch on as it is much more readable). I find the notation a really steep hill to climb (despite having a math degree) as it seems to be "write only", that is, if you understand what the statement says, then you understand it. But until you do, you don't.<br>
Plus there isn't nearly as much emphasis on Types, except the constant bike-shedding on Universes.</p>
<p>There is also a dependence on "funky names" in Lean. If you need more than 1 word for a function there should be an inheritance hierarchy, as usually found in programming. I've been paid to program in 60 languages and I'm still struggling with Lean syntax.</p>

<p>My usual approach to a new programming language is to write a chess playing program (simple rules, simple alpha-beta tree search, simple I/O) but I'm not sure where to begin in Lean.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to Lean 4 as I understand that the kernel will be small and the rest of the language is in Lean. That gives me the opportunity to re-implement the kernel in Lisp and have Lean "be native". That assumes, of course, that there is some natural language documentation of the kernel. I've read the Lean 3 source code and have very little idea what is going on, what rules are implemented, what data structures correspond to (e.g. what is the theorem data structure, the proof data structure, the judgment data structure, and all of the other things you'd expect to find in the kernel).</p>

<p>The kernel is roughly the same size in 4 as it was in 3 (~5000 loc in .cpp files, ~2200 in .h files). I'll eventually re-do the documentation for the Rust one when the v4 branch is more stable. FWIW, reimplementing the kernel might end up becoming a long-cut if your goal is mostly to learn Lean as a programming language though, the gap between what you see in your editor and the kernel representation is pretty big.</p>

<p>I obviously have a lot more to learn about Lean. The idea of having the Lean kernel in Lisp is that they can share data structures directly, which removes the need to communicate. Further, it means that Lean can share Axiom's type hierarchy  and it can show up in output.</p>
<p>In the new version of Axiom (the Sane branch), I want to add "provisos" to output. For example, I want to know that the result as presented provided certain conditions apply. For example, a result might only be valid if its argument is greater than zero, giving<br>
    foo(x)  suchthat x&gt;0<br>
That requires a fair bit of machinery, some of which Lean can assist.</p>
