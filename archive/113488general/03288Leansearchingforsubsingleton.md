What motivates Lean to use 10 second to search for a subsingleton instance?</p>

<p>but I'm afraid one cannot reproduce this because I modified polynomials in some other ways</p>

<p>So unfortunately my link would have to suffice</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 09 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20searching%20for%20subsingleton%3F/near/147398794):
<p>Actually the subsingleton thing might not be related at all</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 09 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20searching%20for%20subsingleton%3F/near/147398798):
<p>I really don't know why Lean uses 10 seconds to elaborate the type</p>

<p>How will it scale when our library gets 2 times bigger?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 09 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20searching%20for%20subsingleton%3F/near/147399015):
<p>Would we need a day to compile the mathlib?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 09 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20searching%20for%20subsingleton%3F/near/147399022):
<p>We only have ~260 files now</p>

<p>also very strangely, if I go to my sandbox and import data.polynomial and do exactly the same thing, it compiles in a fraction in a second</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 09 2018 at 21:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20searching%20for%20subsingleton%3F/near/147399197):
<p>despite the environment being the same</p>

<p>You have been posting some very hard-to-reproduce issues recently</p>

<p>Usually searches for subsingleton instances are prompted by <code>congr</code> (also used inside <code>simp</code>), which will use subsingleton instances to avoid some subgoals</p>

<p>ok</p>
