<p>Hi, for a homework assignment, one of the questions  I have to do is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/2" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/2">#2</a> in section 8.6 of the Logic and Proof book. The question is: "Give a natural deduction proof of  <code>∀x B(x)</code> from hypotheses <code>∀x (A(x) ∨ B(x))</code>, and <code>∀y ¬A(y)</code>. My thoughts were to proof B(x) by contradiction, because by doing so, I get to assume <code>¬ B(x)</code>, and from <code>¬ B(x)</code> and my other assumption ∀y ¬A(y)<code>, I can derive, through De Morgan's laws </code>¬ (A(x) ∨ B(x))`, which should be enough to get the contradiction. Could someone check my proof in the attached picture and perhaps provide feedback? I'd really appreciate it! <a href="/user_uploads/3121/slZZR_2-sBUFMJWCov02sMrN/IMG-1413.JPG" target="_blank" title="IMG-1413.JPG">IMG-1413.JPG</a></p>

<p>I think it is close, but it feels a little off since I have not cancelled all of my hypotheses</p>

<p>Or I guess the two given hypotheses don't need cancelled, since they were simply given?</p>
