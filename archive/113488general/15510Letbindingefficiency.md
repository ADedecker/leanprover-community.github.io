If a term `foo` appears multiple times in a definition in such a way that each occurrence of it will have to be normalized,  does the definition become more efficiently computable by using `let x := foo in` in the beginning? The assumption is that `x` will be structured in a way that forces (some) normalization with the let binding (e.g., if `foo : A Ã— B`, then `let (a,b) := foo`).

yes, although lean does that sometimes on its own, during the common subexpression elimination pass

do you mean in the VM or the kernel?

Note that `let (a,b) := foo` is not a let binding at all, it is just notation for a recursor

I meant the kernel, although I'd be curious about the VM as well.

In the kernel, I am not positive but I would guess that it depends on how shared the expression object is in memory

using a let binding like that is a good way to make sure that the same expression object is used in each place

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152446702):
but there will be some overhead with unfolding it

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152446745):
The kernel caches the whnf operation, so it won't need to calculate it many times if it is asked for multiple times

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152446751):
but I'm not sure whether the same expression in different contexts can cause a problem (since this might mean renaming vars and unsharing)

#### [Seul Baek (Dec 24 2018 at 01:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152446851):
The main downside I'm experiencing with `let` is that it doesn't play nice with the simplifier when I have to prove properties about definitions which include it (`_match_1` all over the place) and requires extra definitional lemmas for unfolding. So I was wondering if there are reasons to use it other than its concision.

If `let (a,b) := foo` is not a let binding, is there something else I can do to normalize `foo` and bind it to fresh term(s)?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152447329):
like I said, it's just a recursor. If you don't like the `_match_1` stuff, you can use tactics instead to construct the term, which don't leave this junk in the term

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152447337):
i.e. `by cases foo with a b; exact`

#### [Mario Carneiro (Dec 24 2018 at 01:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Let%20binding%20efficiency/near/152447343):
it's equivalent to writing `prod.rec` explicitly in the term

I see. Thanks!
