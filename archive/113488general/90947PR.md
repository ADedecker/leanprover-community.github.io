#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 07:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124870985):
@**Mario Carneiro**, I've fixed all your suggestions on https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/94. Thanks!

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871841):
@**Mario Carneiro** how come you didn't notice that `subgroup` is already there =P

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 08:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871884):
I assumed that scott would have noticed :P

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 08:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871886):
You should move all this stuff from the `group` folder to `group_theory`

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 08:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871941):
Speaking of two developments, I think I prefer Scott's definition of `subgroup` to the one that's there (Kenny's?), which is being clever combining two axioms into one. That's the sort of thing you do in an auxiliary constructor theorem, not in the definition

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871978):
that isn't mine

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871983):
I would never do such things :P

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871985):
it's johoelzl's work

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124871999):
@**Johannes Hölzl** someone is challenging your style

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 08:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872002):
looks like it

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 08:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872587):
I don't mind changing the definition of `is_subgroup`. I guess now we want to have `is_submonoid` and than `is_subgroup` as an extension? @**Kenny Lau** did you find some time to work on your free groups? As I remember the were submonoids involved?

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872643):
there's no submonoid in my free group

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872645):
there are monoids with involutions, maybe that's what confuses you

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872650):
there are also monoid homomorphisms

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 08:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872867):
Ah, okay. I think the monoid homomorphism confused me.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 08:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872911):
Now I found it, `is_submonoid` is already in `algebra/group.lean`. I will do some cleanup.

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872920):
aha!

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872924):
that's indeed my work for the localization isn't it

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872976):
https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/c852939f5fcb3a1f0ebe38d8eebc6aede22b9e25#diff-52b9e281e7667f88f8203fb617843d93

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 08:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124872977):
yes it is

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878465):
@**Johannes Hölzl**, in my group theory PR I just added a commit modifying your `subgroup.lean`. You said higher in the thread that you would do some cleanup --- if possible could we coordinate to avoid having merge issues later?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878481):
(Sorry, all for not noticing Johannes work. Mitchell did his work back in January, and I didn't noticed Johannes' work being committed in the meantime.)

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 11:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878523):
Would be good, mostly I changed `is_subgroup` to extend `is_submonoid` and moved `is_submonoid`, also I'm adding `gpowers`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878533):
It sounds like everyone agrees that the "3 axiom" version of `is_subgroup` is better than the "2 axiom" version, so maybe we could switch that as well?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878542):
I'm curious also about the naming. I (or rather, Mitchell) had written just `subgroup`, where you have `is_subgroup`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878545):
Is `is_subgroup` obviously better?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878552):
Somehow when I think of it as a typeclass rather than a predicate `subgroup` seems more natural to me.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 11:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878755):
`is_subgroup` is not (yet) a type class. I'm not sure if it is a good idea to make structures like this type classes, for me sets and functions are to fluid in some sense to be nice type classes. This is also a reason why I  don't like morphism predicates like `is_group_hom` etc to be type classes. But on the other hand they mostly work well, so maybe we should stay with this approach.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878802):
Ah, I hadn't even realised that we might not want `is_subgroup` to be a type class, although I should have from the mere fact that you didn't do this!

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878803):
The other thing is that we might want to use `subgroup := {s // is_subgroup s}`. for the bundled type

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878821):
I guess I was anticipating the naming convention was `Subgroup := { s // subgroup s}`.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 11:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878961):
True. There might be also `Group := sigma A : Type, group A`, and then `Subgroup` could be over `Group`. But I guess we don't need this yet. And in the worst case it could be in its own namespace.

For the current PR: can you revert your changes on `group_theory/subgroup`? Then I will push my changes, as far as I see it you don't use it yet.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 11:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124878969):
Or would this be work for you?

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 12:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124879276):
Also the `is_` convention is also coming from `is_commutative` etc. which is a `Prop` and talks about operators and not types. This is another reason why I slightly prefer `is_subgroup` for this kind of type classes.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 12:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124880527):
Okay, I will work out how to revert my changes to `group_theory/subgroup`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 10 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124880583):
Okay, I've done this. Just let me know once you've pushed yours.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 10 2018 at 13:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124881464):
@**Kenny Lau** @**Mario Carneiro** I moved `is_submonoid` from `algebra/group` to its own file `group_theory/submonoid.lean`. Maybe it should be in `algebra` after all, but I think it shouldn't be part of the base, i.e. it shouldn't be part of what most theories import.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 01:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124908083):

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 01:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124908093):
(Silly question, sorry)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 06:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124917374):
Okay, I've successfully combined Mitchell's and Johannes' work on subgroups, and my PR <https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/94> looks mostly good to me --- there are a few TODOs where I need help, in particular the typeclass resolution problem I was having earlier is still there; unfortunately Mario's suggestions don't seem to have helped.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124926513):
Thanks, @**Johannes Hölzl** for merging that and making some final stylistic changes.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124927069):
There's one change that I'd like to disagree with, however. I saw that you changed a number of `group G` to `group α`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124927082):
I know this is according to style.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124927094):
I think @**Kevin Buzzard** and @**Patrick Massot** have already asked about this, but I want to add my vote too --- could we please consider changing the style rule so that types for which mathematicians would always use some particular letters for, can use those letters, rather than lower case greek letters?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124927139):
I'm just not going to be taken seriously if I call a group `α`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 12:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124927160):
(As an aside, for a long time I've been making fun of (/exasperated by) physicists for using standard notations in the place of proper definitions --- just knowing that `Z` is a partition function, etc. I now feel properly chastised and sorry for my past bad behaviour, realising that I can't cope with groups that aren't called `G`.)

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 11 2018 at 13:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124929093):
Hm, slightly prefer `α` as it is a type and not a group, i.e. it is only the groups support type. What I prefer in following this style is that I don't need to think how to call certain elements I just follow the general rules. Btw, I will change more, I simplified most of the proofs and generalized some statement.s

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 11 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124937052):
Really, groups should be called G. It only helps readability, especially since you also insist on separating the carrier type and the instance in `(α : Type*) (β : Type*) [group α] [group β]` instead of `(α : Type*) [group α] (β : Type*)  [group β]`

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 11 2018 at 20:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124944334):
I don't see what the ordering of variables has to do with naming here. The idea is that greek letters label types (or "underlying sets" of things), while `Group`s would be labeled with `G` or `H` or whatever; it's just that these never come up because we don't use `Group` (the bundled one) in mathlib currently.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Apr 11 2018 at 20:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124944578):
Patrick's point is that it is even less clear that one should think of `\alpha` and `\beta` as groups, because the place where they are introduced is visually not located next to the fact that you have an instance of `group`

#### [ Johan Commelin (Apr 11 2018 at 20:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124944583):
Does it make sense what I am saying?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Apr 11 2018 at 20:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124944655):
If it were ordered as `(α : Type*) [group α] (β : Type*)  [group β]` that would improve readability, because one does not have to scan very far ahead to figure out that `α` is a group.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 11 2018 at 21:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124947047):
Is this really normal in computer science to demand that every variable of a certain type must be called one of three characters and that's the end of it?

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 11 2018 at 21:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124947050):
From my point of view this is crazy.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 11 2018 at 21:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124947221):
Does this kind of convention exist in Isabelle? I checked it isn't use in Coq's Feit-Thompson stuff.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 23:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124952035):
It's just going to make mathematicians' heads explode if groups aren't called `G`, rings `R`, categories `𝒞`, manifolds `M`, etc. I've been convinced that typeclasses really are nice (after initially being very dubious), but if the expense is that the actual names of the things we're talking about never get mentioned (because it's rarely necessary to write `[G : Group α]`) then I'm going back to dubious.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Apr 11 2018 at 23:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124952517):
Given that typeclass arguments rarely receive names, I think a good convention is just that, like in the usual mathematicians' convention, we use the same name for the "underlying thing" (i.e. the type) and the "extra structure on it". I agree that if they were being referred to separately it would be more correct to name the typeclass `G` and the type `α`, but when they're not I want to keep the name `G`.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124953600):
It's not just that, it's just going to make arguments harder to follow. It's as simple as that.

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Apr 12 2018 at 08:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/PR/near/124971719):
In Isabelle type variables get a prime at the start, i.e. they are all names `'a`, `'b`, ... sometimes people are more specific and use `'state`. But at least `'a`, etc refer to alpha etc.

If we look now into `group_theory.coset`, the name $$\alpha$$ gets introduced at the beginning, and only occasionally refers to groups. So it doesn't make sense to call it `G` anymore. At least not globally in the file. We can give it different names in different section of that theory.
