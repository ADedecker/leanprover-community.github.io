<p>I have been reading <code>replace_fn.cpp</code> and <code>kabstract.cpp</code>, to no avail: my understanding of what is going on there suggests the second example should still work.</p>

<p>the goal has become <code>[2, 1, 2] = [1, 2, 2]</code>, and not <code>[2, 1, 2] = [2, 2, 2]</code>. That is, why did rewrite give up on the rhs?</p>

<p><code>kabstract</code> does not backtrack from unification: once <code>l</code> has been assigned <code>[1, 2]</code>, it does not consider other values for it</p>

<p>I see, that <code>ctx.unify</code> call in <code>kabstract</code> is saving information about things it has seen before.</p>

<p>So... if I really really wanted be be able to generate a list of all the rewrites of some expression <code>e</code> by some rule <code>r</code> (where we just rewrite in one place), is there any hope?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123546763):
<p>It seems that just calling <code>rw [r] at e {occs := occurrences.pos n}</code> and gradually increasing <code>n</code> until it fails is doomed, because of this "feature" of <code>kabstract</code>.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 10 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547082):
<p>if you want to hack a solution together, you might have to copy / paste the implementation of <code>rw</code> and reimplement <code>kabstract</code>. I think the key is to undo the assignment of meta variable. One way of to that is to traverse your expression and create new meta variables to replace the ones that you find.</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 10 2018 at 22:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547088):
<p>Yes. It just won't be very fast.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 10 2018 at 22:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547146):
<p>I assume with the new focus on Lean 4, that might be the one way to get the fixed tactic sooner than later.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547154):
<p>I see: reimplement <code>kabstract</code> in Lean?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547198):
<p>I was just trying to find the definition of <code>type_context_old</code>, and see if there was any hope of hacking on an extra option that would change this behaviour. But I agree it's exceedingly unlikely I could propose such a change.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 10 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547201):
<p>yeah pretty much. Unless <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> agrees that the current semantics is wrong and is willing to fix it for you</p>

<p>It's been that way since Lean 2, where it was even documented afair :)</p>

<p>Looks like I will think about a really slow version of kabstract!</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547259):
<p>(Context here is that I'm otherwise really happy with my <code>rewrite_search</code> tactic, based on greedily minimising edit distance. I have "real" examples where it successfully finds long (~10) chains of rewrites that complete a proof. Unfortunately sometimes it mysteriously fails, and this seems to be the issue.)</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 10 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547262):
<p>It's not even clear to me what a different <code>kabstract</code> would look like. Would it introduce <code>n</code> lambdas and return <code>n</code> instantiated copies of <code>e</code>?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 10 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547305):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110524">@Scott Morrison</span> I suppose repeatedly rewriting will not solve your problem? :)</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547311):
<p>No -- I have lots of examples where the rewrite rule needs to be applied "inside" a bigger expression where the rewrite rule also applies.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547312):
<p>But after you do the outer rewrite the inner rewrite is no longer available.</p>

<p>(<code>rewrite_search</code> is already trying repeated rewrites itself: I only discovered this problem because it was mysteriously failing.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>, I guess I was thinking not actually to reimplement <code>kabstract</code>, but reimplement all of <code>rewrite_core</code>.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547416):
<p>(Reimplementing <code>kabstract</code> in Lean would not be helpful, because no tactics actually call it from Lean: only things in c++.)</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 10 2018 at 22:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547458):
<p>I'm not sure how you want to solve your issue with the current kabstract</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547464):
<p>Or rather, to write something called <code>all_rewrites</code>, that takes an expr, and a list of lemmas, and returns <code>list (expr \times expr)</code>, where the pairs are the result of using the lemma in one place, and the proof.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547505):
<p>It would work by recursively going down into the expr, and repeatedly calling unify ... oh, I see your point.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 22:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547509):
<p>Those calls to unify are _also_ going to be cached. :-(</p>

<p>Well, not if you create new mvars like Simon suggested</p>

<p>I see; after every time you successfully find a match, you throw out the mvar you were passing to unify and make a new one.</p>

<p>Oh -- I knew that you had been discussing with Mario about what looked like a major refactoring job on the category theory library and I was just kind of assumed this might be something to do with the refactoring</p>

<p>I believe in rewrite, when you use <code>âˆ€ x, f x = g x</code> as your rewrite rule, you generate one mvar to instantiate x and you start matching. What you can do instead is create a unique local constant to instantiate x with (or as many as you have bound variable) and you create a table mapping those constants to mvars every time you attempt a match</p>

<p>Btw, it might be easier to build something on top of <code>tactic.ext_simplify_core</code>. You basically get a very configurable term DFS where you can return subterm equality proofs pre or post visit and the tactic takes care of composing them into the complete proof.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Mar 10 2018 at 23:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rewrite%20occs/near/123547692):

<p>I don't have any good suggestions for your rewrite issue. One possibility is to use <code>conv</code> or <code>ext_simplify_core</code> to recurse into all subterms and try <code>rw</code> on each of them</p>

<p>Is there any hope that I could build a pattern corresponding to the lhs of my rewrite rule, and pass that to <code>conv</code>, and thereby only visit the places where <code>rw</code> would work anyway? Or would this run into exactly the same unification caching problem?</p>

<p>I think in the end <code>ext_simplify_core</code> is going to be the right solution. Since I want to build up a list of all the possible rewrites, I think it makes sense to build it up during the run of <code>ext_simplify_core</code>, rather than making multiple calls into conv, each one looking at a different piece of the expression.</p>

<p>Oh thanks! I honestly behave like a computer.

<p>So Scott what are you actually trying to do in the long run here? What is the problem with just writing a tactic which tries every possible rw on some term using some set of terms which are equalities but with metavariables? Is that what you want? Isn't that exactly the sort of thing one can write a tactic for? Or is the point that you want to do it without writing a tactic?</p>

<p>And a related question. Is Sebastian saying "there is something written in C++ which doesn't do what you want, but you could write a version in Lean which does do what you want but it would be slow"? And how does this contrast with Leo's Lean 4 plan -- goal <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1">#1</a> in fact -- of taking some stuff out of C++ and implementing it in Lean?</p>

<p>so I couldn't use show to replace X on LHS with something defeq because cut and paste wouldn't work for RHS. So I used conv and then realised I didn't know how to do show in conv mode and ended proving some auxiliary lemma with rfl and doing a rw. This way is much cooler :-)</p>
