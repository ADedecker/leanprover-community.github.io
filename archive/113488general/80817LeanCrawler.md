<p>Yesterday I release the preliminary hacky version of my Lean library crawler at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leancrawler" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leancrawler">https://github.com/leanprover-community/leancrawler</a>. It's in the community organization so don't hesitate to request push access if you want to make it much better</p>

<p>It's the piece of sofware behind the mathlib quiz and graphs like <a href="/user_uploads/3121/XzFHNlRBfK7XaSQQ_Wacjz1I/big_comp.png" target="_blank" title="big_comp.png">big_comp.png</a></p>
