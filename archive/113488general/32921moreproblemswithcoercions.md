So... I've been trying to implement @**Mario Carneiro**'s suggestion that I define the coercion allowing `F X` for a functor `F` on an object `X`, and define a @[simp] lemma unfolding the coercion.

I immediately run into trouble, however, where `simp` fails to apply the simp lemma, because a `motive is not correct`:

Here's my slightly minimised example:

You have to use `dsimp`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130958983):
is there a reason you use `by refl` instead of `rfl` to prove rfl-lemmas?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130958989):
this messes up dsimp

ah..

I never knew that.

Okay. That should fix my problems, but wow, gross! :-)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959047):
You should always prove definitional theorems by `rfl`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959096):
because lean reads that specially: `A = B := rfl` means `A === B`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Aug 06 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959098):
what does `by refl` do?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959100):
It proves the theorem normally, so you just end up learning `A = B`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Aug 06 2018 at 07:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959101):
surely that's the same thing

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Aug 06 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959109):
but isn't the proof term the same either way?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Aug 06 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959111):
I guess I can check.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 07:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959112):
it is, but the literal token `rfl` is used by the lean parser to add the `@[_refl_lemma]` attribute

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Aug 06 2018 at 07:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959361):
It really is a pity that `refl` and `rfl` have such important but subtle distinctions, while only differing by one letter.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Aug 06 2018 at 07:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130959364):
And then `rfl` (without `e`) adds `@[_refl_lemma]` (with `e`)!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 08:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130960266):
to be fair, one is a tactic and one is a term, so they differ by more than one letter

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 08:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130960280):
although you shouldn't confuse `rfl` with `eq.refl` either

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 08:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130960327):
similarly there is `iff.rfl` and `iff.refl`, etc. The naming convention has `rfl` have an implicit argument and `refl` has an explicit arg

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Aug 06 2018 at 08:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more%20problems%20with%20coercions/near/130961287):
Thanks for explaining this `rfl` vs `refl` thing. Switching to `rfl` really helps, both here and elsewhere. :-)
