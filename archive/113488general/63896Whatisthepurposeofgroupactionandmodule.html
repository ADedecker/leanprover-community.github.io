<p>There are certain classes which are defined to be exactly some other class, with the only difference that they make more assumptions on the carrier types. Examples: a <code>group_action</code> is exactly a <code>monoid_action</code> where the acting monoid is a group; a <code>module</code> is exactly a <code>semimodule</code> where the scalar semiring is a ring.<br>
What is the purpose of such classes. Do they only exist for reasons of terminology, or are there also other benefits?</p>

<p>I did it like that because somebody complained about not having <code>vector_space</code>, and I thought they might complain about this as well.</p>
