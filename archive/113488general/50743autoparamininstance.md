Is it possible to use autoparam in instances? I have a `is_add_group_hom` instance that never triggers, probably because is it contains a continuity assumption. The following doesn't seem to help:
```lean
instance sep_quot.is_add_group_hom_lift [separated Î²]  (hf : continuous f . tactic.assumption) : is_add_group_hom (sep_quot.lift f) := ...
```

Isn't this evidence that `continuous` should be a class?

Of course this also came to my mind

Here it would clearly help

/me doesn't know why group homs should be a class and continuous maps not...

```
 No, auto_params are handled by the elaborator.  Type class instance synthesis does not know about auto_param (or optional parameters).

Thanks Gabriel

neither should be a class

not group homs. not continuous maps. not linear maps.

So... what *should* be a class?

#### [Kenny Lau (Dec 18 2018 at 13:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/autoparam in instance/near/152105320):
groups and topological spaces and modules?

Why???

#### [Kenny Lau (Dec 18 2018 at 13:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/autoparam in instance/near/152105431):
how is it done in your category theory?

Continuous maps not a class -- Johannes has explained this before on this forum, although I have never really internalised the issue.
