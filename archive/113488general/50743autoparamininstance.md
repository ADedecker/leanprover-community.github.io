<p>Is it possible to use autoparam in instances? I have a <code>is_add_group_hom</code> instance that never triggers, probably because is it contains a continuity assumption. The following doesn't seem to help:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">instance</span> <span class="n">sep_quot</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">is_add_group_hom_lift</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">separated</span> <span class="n">Î²</span><span class="o">]</span>  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hf</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">continuous</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">.</span> <span class="n">tactic</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">assumption</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">is_add_group_hom</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sep_quot</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">lift</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">...</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Isn't this evidence that <code>continuous</code> should be a class?</p>

<p>Of course this also came to my mind</p>

<p>Here it would clearly help</p>

<p>/me doesn't know why group homs should be a class and continuous maps not...</p>

<p>No, auto_params are handled by the elaborator.  Type class instance synthesis does not know about auto_param (or optional parameters).</p>

<p>Thanks Gabriel</p>

<p>neither should be a class</p>

<p>not group homs. not continuous maps. not linear maps.</p>

<p>So... what <em>should</em> be a class?</p>

<p>groups and topological spaces and modules?</p>

<p>Why???</p>

<p>how is it done in your category theory?</p>

<p>Continuous maps not a class -- Johannes has explained this before on this forum, although I have never really internalised the issue.</p>
