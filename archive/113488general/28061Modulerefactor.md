#### [Kenny Lau (Jan 08 2019 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Module%20refactor/near/154648106):
[I have refactored modules in order to make it possible for a module to be based on two rings.](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/module-refactor) However, there is a small part in analysis/normed_space written by @**Patrick Massot** and @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl** which I do not know how to fix. I would be grateful if they could kindly offer their assistance.
