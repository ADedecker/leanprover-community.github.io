#### [Keeley Hoek (Sep 21 2018 at 13:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Stubborn unify/near/134372143):
I've been experimenting with some of the `tactic.*` namespace, which I'm admittedly pretty scared of since some of it seems like magic. In trying to accomplish my nefarious goals, I'm running into quite a wall with `unify` and friends. It's seeming more and more like `unify` is more stubborn (an idiot?) than I first thought; for example, the following happens when I try to `unify` two metavar-containing types (which I think is sensible?)
````
unify tactic failed, failed to unify
  ?m_1 тед ?m_3 : Type (max ? ? ? ?)
and
  D тед C : Type (max (?+1) ? (?+1))
````
(There are hypotheses `D` and `C` with type `Type (?+1)` .)

Why is `unify` not compelled to assign the values of `?m_1` and `?m_3` in this situation?

Unifying complex universe terms is often a mess. If you can manage to avoid `max` and `imax` in your universe terms, I would go for that. Otherwise, you may need to specifying universes explicitly when resolving constants.

Yeah, get rid of all your ?s in exchange for explicit named universes, and you'll probably see what the obstruction is.
