why does lean automatically tag certain theorems with `@[_refl_lemma]`?

I want to know too!

That attribute means that it's a refl lemma (it was proven by `rfl`), and it is basically "`@[simp]` for `dsimp`"

someday i'd like to write a boilerplate macro that goes into definitions and creates lemmas for each branch

although even better is if we could suggest names while  constructing a `def` using the equation compiler

Is this necessary because definitional equality is not transitive?

No, it's just a way to guide the operation of `dsimp`. There are loads of things that are defeq, so how should it know you want `a + succ b` to "unfold" to `succ (a + b)` and not something else? Equation lemmas are used for this purpose, and the ones that are known to be definitional are legal for use by `dsimp`

Does `dsimp` use anything else?

It uses the bracket list of course, but most of its stuff comes from equation lemmas

`def` does this currently...
