Should we reply to https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1920#issuecomment-368691909 ? I'd like someone to thank Leo, but I'm not sure what would upset him more (I could thank him myself, but discovering some new Lean user could be upsetting).

I don't think he's that volatile. He's a very nice guy despite the way he's portrayed here :P a couple of weeks ago I decided to write him an email to tell him how amazing Lean is and thank him. He seemed happy about it

Ok, I tried my luck.
