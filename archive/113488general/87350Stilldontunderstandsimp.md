<p>fully expecting it to work, and it didn't. So I switched to <code>by simp at H;assumption</code> which works fine -- but I feel like I'm missing a trick. What is the correct way to solve this goal? I know I could prove it using <code>zero_add</code> a couple of times -- is best practice to spell out the proof in full or use automation?</p>

<p>It is hard to get the analysis exactly right without just recompiling the current file, and if it's not exactly right then there is the possibility of incorrect hints, which will get old fast</p>
