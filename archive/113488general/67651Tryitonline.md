So it's like VScode, with goals on the right.

I'm afraid that isn't possible, since every other language on the site uses the same layout

@**Kenny Lau** Why not `â„•` instead of `nat`?

you could `import data.rat` and save one character

yes, as long as you don't update the standard library after the challenge

wait, kenny's last post on this thread is a codegolf for the number of surjections, plus a proof of correctness. Why doesn't mathlib have that?

We could just start working on getting all of OEIS in, right?

I don't see any reason we shouldn't have the stirling numbers defined, especially if you have a nice thing to prove about them

I'm not saying we should all go out and formalize OEIS, but if someone has already gone to the trouble of formalizing some of it, I'd like to get in on that
