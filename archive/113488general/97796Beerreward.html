<p>Starting on January 14th, I'll be teaching my <a href="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114/" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114/">Lean-powered undergraduate course</a> again. Last year I was so afraid of the installation procedure on Windows that I didn't tell my students to try to install Lean at home. But this turned out to be a huge issue. So I'm offering <strong>as much beer as you can drink</strong> during <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html">Fomm2020</a> to anyone contributing to a download-and-click-only install of Lean+VScode+plugin+update-mathlib on Windows which then allows to download and unzip a project containing a compiled mathlib and use it without recompiling or typing any command in a shell. Ideally this should work on any version of Windows that my students could have, but having the main current version covered would already be nice. Useful starting points could include: <a href="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer</a> and <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri" target="_blank" title="https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri">https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri</a> or similar (one can only assume students will have an installation of python fighting Lean, not helping it). Let me ping potential windows users: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130308">@Neil Strickland</span></p>

<p>Would an installer be necessary? It seems to me you could just make a zip file. Some combination of VSCode portable mode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable" target="_blank" title="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable</a>, configuring the VSCode settings file, and bundling Lean and Mathlib.</p>
