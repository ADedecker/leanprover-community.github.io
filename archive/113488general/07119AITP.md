<p>Here is a conference on AI and Theorem Proving: <a href="http://aitp-conference.org/2019/" target="_blank" title="http://aitp-conference.org/2019/">http://aitp-conference.org/2019/</a><br>
The co-chair, Josef Urban, just told me that his ML system can now prove about 50% of Mizar's library.</p>

<p>I really wish that we could interface with that system, and have it write 50% of our proofs for us.</p>

<p>Asking google about Josef Urban doesn't immediately leads to what I was looking for...</p>

<p>I found it eventually, although google thinks this is less interesting that marathon runner having clothing issues</p>

<p>I may try to go. I met Josef at Dagstuhl.</p>
