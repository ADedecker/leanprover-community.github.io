<p>yes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am inside a lambda expression with variable x and running a tactic, what would it's name be? anonymous?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on whether the lambda has been abstracted or not. If the variable <code>x</code> is currently in the local context (i.e. left of the turnstile) then <code>x</code> will be represented in expressions as a <code>expr.local_const</code>. If <code>x</code> is bound in an expression, then it is nameless, <code>var 0</code> or such</p>

<p>If this conversation were going about ten times more slowly I feel like I could learn something from it. I know that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> had plans to learn something about tactics this summer, but my impression was that when he realised he had 100 questions he decided that it was unreasonable to spam the chat with them all, and of course I was no help. Chris and I between us can deal with essentially all the questions the other undergrads are throwing at us because we both now have a robust understanding of how to do mathematics in Lean, but we are still lacking a tactic guru and I don't quite know what to do about it.</p>

<p>Lean doesn't make it particularly easy to get the full list. You are supposed to be responsible with your goal management so you don't "drop" any goals you will need later. But it is possible, while expensive, to just crawl the <code>result</code> looking for metavars. The <code>metavariables</code> tactic in mathlib does this</p>

<p>I don't know if there is a way to avoid the <code>intro</code> - you need a way to change the local context</p>

<p>there will also be a <code>type_context</code> monad for statefully dealing with the type context. Right now it gets reinitialized a lot which makes doing custom expr traversals really expensive in lean</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this is good idea. Those books, especially TPIL, have a unity of vision and style. It makes reading them feel like reading a book and not a technical reference. You can suggest improvements and additional topics, I did that and Jeremy used some. But otherwise I think we should rather write other sources of documentation.</p>
