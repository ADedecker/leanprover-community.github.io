<p>In a file with <code>noncomputable theory</code>, I get the trace message</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>failed to generate bytecode for &#39;locally_compact_of_compact&#39;
code generation failed, VM does not have code for &#39;locally_compact_of_compact_nhds&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>What does this mean, and should I worry?</p>

<p><a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/subject/finsets.2C.20decidable_mem.2C.20and.20filter/near/133708032" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/subject/finsets.2C.20decidable_mem.2C.20and.20filter/near/133708032">I got that message before</a> when I had accidentally labeled a def as a theorem / lemma. Not sure if that applies in your case or not.</p>

<p>Usually it means there is a lemma whose type is not a Prop, yes. In this case it is because I forgot to mark <code>locally_compact_space</code> as a Prop.</p>

<p>Indeed, it solves the problem. Thanks!</p>

<p>I have a fix for mathlib</p>
