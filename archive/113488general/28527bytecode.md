In a file with `noncomputable theory`, I get the trace message
```
failed to generate bytecode for 'locally_compact_of_compact'
code generation failed, VM does not have code for 'locally_compact_of_compact_nhds'
```
What does this mean, and should I worry?

[I got that message before](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/subject/finsets.2C.20decidable_mem.2C.20and.20filter/near/133708032) when I had accidentally labeled a def as a theorem / lemma. Not sure if that applies in your case or not.

Usually it means there is a lemma whose type is not a Prop, yes. In this case it is because I forgot to mark `locally_compact_space` as a Prop.

Indeed, it solves the problem. Thanks!

I have a fix for mathlib
