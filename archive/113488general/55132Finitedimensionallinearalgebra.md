@**Kenny Lau**  I am currently doing linear algebra on lean. I heard that you already did something on it. Could you plz tell me how far are you?

did I?

@**Kevin Buzzard** it might be the one from year 2

`Authors: Johannes HÃ¶lzl, Kenny Lau` from the top of `linear_algebra.linear_map_module`

but those are in mathlib

I found them.

Is it worth making a new type `finite_dimensional_vector_space`?

Yup, I think we need to make a new type for it
