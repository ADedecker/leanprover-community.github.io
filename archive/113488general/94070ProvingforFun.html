<p>Dear Lean enthusiasts,</p>
<p>I'd like to advertise to you "Proving for Fun" -- an online platform where you can tackle proving challenges in your favorite proof assistant -- and ask for your help adding Lean as a supported language.</p>
<p><a href="https://competition.isabelle.systems/competitions/contest/11/" target="_blank" title="https://competition.isabelle.systems/competitions/contest/11/">https://competition.isabelle.systems/competitions/contest/11/</a></p>
<p>This month's contest features freshly implemented support for Coq. This means you can now submit your solutions in both Isabelle and Coq. We want to support more ITPs and ACL2 is about to join. The contest is open until 9 August 2019.</p>
<p>Thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198376">@Kevin Kappelmann</span>, we now also have a judging backend for Lean. We have translations for three of the tasks of this month's contest and they are up for your solutions. Please feel free to give feedback on the system and help translating the rest of the tasks; in the latter case please contact me here at zulip or via email (<a href="mailto:haslbema@in.tum.de" title="mailto:haslbema@in.tum.de">haslbema@in.tum.de</a>).</p>
<p>This month's contest also serves as a warmup for the <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/" target="_blank" title="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground/">"Proof Ground" workshop</a>, which<br>
will take place in September alongside the ITP conference in Portland. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the ITP<br>
community, to discuss and compete in a "proving contest", and it will use the Proving for Fun platform. If you happen to have ideas for<br>
interesting tasks, please consider submitting them following our "Call for Problems".</p>
<p>We believe our problems should be a stimulating fun summer activity! We encourage you to participate and give us feedback on the prototype system.</p>
<p>Happy proving!</p>

<p>Caveat: There is no support for mathlib (yet). Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/maxhaslbeck/proving-contest-backends/tree/master/Lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/maxhaslbeck/proving-contest-backends/tree/master/Lean">contribute here</a> if you think that Lean without mathlib <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert#cite_ref-34" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert#cite_ref-34">is the same as prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists</a>.</p>
