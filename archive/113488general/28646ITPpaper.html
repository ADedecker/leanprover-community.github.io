<p>In case there was any doubt: we're pleased to announce that Ellenberg and Gijswijt's solution to the cap set problem (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223">https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223</a>) is definitely correct!</p>
<p>The Lean code still needs a bit of cleanup. We'll make that public very soon. But in the meantime, here's a draft of our paper for ITP: <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/e-g/e-g.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://lean-forward.github.io/e-g/e-g.pdf">https://lean-forward.github.io/e-g/e-g.pdf</a></p>
<p>We'll submit this on Sunday. Any comments or suggestions before then are more than welcome.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> and Rob I am really pleased that you have managed to get this job out the door.  Jordan asked me about its progress several times and I was scared that Johannes was going to leave Amsterdam and the project was going to peter out before it was finished. </p>
<p>I have said this several times before but let me try and hammer the point home again. Professional mathematicians do not really seem to care that old results like the odd order theorem have been formally verified. This is counterintuitive to me but it is absolutely what I see in practice when I talk to mathematicians up and down the UK. These results are old and people have proved far more nowadays, so they know the original results are fine and don't need formally verifying. What I am trying to do with the perfectoid project, and what this paper I think does very well, is to say "look, modern maths can be formalised nowadays, formalisers are a tool and this tool is being used to analyse recent stuff. Formalisers are becoming relevant". This paper adds more weight to my argument. Mathematicians still seem to think that formalising a paper like this is out of reach, or will take forever or something.</p>
