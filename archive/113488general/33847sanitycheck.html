<p>I'm working a bit on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/fpvandoorn/04837ea7f20479bcac9a99539d2c17b3" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/fpvandoorn/04837ea7f20479bcac9a99539d2c17b3">#sanity_check cleanup</a> of topology. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> Is there a reason why the command is not imported by default? Each file needs to add an import and then remember to remove it. It would also help tremendously if the command could print the type of the unused argument instead of only the number. But it's already very nice! What is weird is that removing useless type classes can have unexpected consequences on elaboration later one. I already had to add a couple of <code>apply_instance</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe we could have a hole command dumping the output of #sanity_check into the Lean file, that would save a copy-paste</p>

<p>Another potential improvement: when the command find an unused argument, check whether it's duplicated and report it.</p>
