More livestreaming: https://www.twitch.tv/colimit
Trying something a little different today: going to try to solve [problem 5](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=2018_IMO_Problems/Problem_5) from this year's IMO in Lean.

What proof are you formalising?

I looked away for a few minutes and suddenly we'd gone from manipulating a sum to padics.

I don't know how well this will work, but I'll try streaming when I can. Watch me work on quotient modules today: https://www.twitch.tv/digama0

I woke up just in time!

I just watched a bit of the start of Reid's. Dealing with producing the finset {1,2,..., n-1} was pretty painful!

@**Mario Carneiro** didn't upload the video?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Sep 24 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/livestreaming/near/134513776):
I'm not sure one was recorded. I'll figure that out for next time

@**Reid Barton**  will probably be able to tell you where the option for saving videos is.
