<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, I'm hoping one of you can have a look at &lt;<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/382" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/382">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/382</a>&gt; for me. (It's a replacement for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/324" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/324">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/324</a>, which has been up for a few weeks; I cleaned up the history and left the previous discussion at the old PR.)</p>
<p>I need to build further on this PR in order to build one more tactic before I can continue migrating my category theory library (limits and colimits), but I'd like to be sure this first PR is okay.</p>

<p>This PR just extends the syntax of <code>solve_by_elim</code>, allowing the user at add or remove additional lemmas or hypotheses from the set of lemmas that are applied.</p>
