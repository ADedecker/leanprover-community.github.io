Hi @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl**, @**Mario Carneiro**, I'm hoping one of you can have a look at <https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/382> for me. (It's a replacement for https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/324, which has been up for a few weeks; I cleaned up the history and left the previous discussion at the old PR.)

I need to build further on this PR in order to build one more tactic before I can continue migrating my category theory library (limits and colimits), but I'd like to be sure this first PR is okay.

This PR just extends the syntax of `solve_by_elim`, allowing the user at add or remove additional lemmas or hypotheses from the set of lemmas that are applied.
