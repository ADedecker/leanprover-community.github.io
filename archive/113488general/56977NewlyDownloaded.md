I am using LEAN for a discrete math class. I just downloaded it for a project. Is there anything that I need to also download or is using the LEAN extension in Visual Studio all I need to get going?

nope, the lean extension + lean is all you need to start hacking around

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8U6YOK7c0M&t=7s is the mac one. If you are only doing super-basic maths then core Lean might have what you need, but the moment you want something like the binomial theorem you're going to need the maths library.
