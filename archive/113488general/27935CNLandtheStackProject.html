<p>I just watched <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115334">@Thales</span> talk from last week, on CNL and Formal Abstracts. I was wondering about the following question: would it be interesting to attempt to pre-process the Stacks Project into something that is readable by the CNL? Is it reasonable to think that this is possible? (cc people that might know more about this: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="221640">@Peter Koepke</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116045">@Jesse Michael Han</span>)</p>

<p>One reason for suggesting the Stacks Project is that it is written in a very strict subset of LaTeX</p>

<p>it would be interesting, and definitely easier than preprocessing a less uniform corpus like all math pages from e.g. Wikipedia</p>
<p>besides working in a small subset of LaTeX, the CNL parser only accepts certain canned phrases in a certain order, so some NLP will be required to align the informal text with CNL equivalents</p>

<p>Yup, I guess it won't be trivial. But for an informal text, the Stacks Project is written rather on the formal side of the spectrum.</p>

<p>That's another reason why I think it might be an interesting target.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I thought about a baby version of this problem. Together with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="223577">@Josef Urban</span> we tried to "linkify" the Stacks Project: whenever a concept was defined in SP, link back to it when it is used later. We used some very basic NLP, but nothing fancy. As far as I remember, the results were cute, but not impressive. Also: I had to write a PhD thesis, so I stopped working on it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I have any code left from that side project.</p>

<p>Stacks tags the term being defined in each definition too, which is helpful.</p>

<p>Right, its unfortunate they don't use a more descriptive macro, but I guess that's counter to the whole philosophy of a strict subset of latex</p>

<p>I don't expect that you'll find many false positive <code>{\it ...}</code> patterns inside definition environments.</p>

<p>It is true that one definition environment might contain multiple definitions.</p>

<p>I have an even babier version of what you are talking about set up for my own notes (nothing fancy at all, just matching exact strings + pluralization) but it works passably, the main difficulties are stacked adjectives (complete separated noetherian scheme) and mathematics overloading (even stacks has normal subgroups and normal schemes) I'd imagine your NLP approach would deal with the latter quite well?</p>

<p>No, our NLP wasn't very NLP at all. IIRC we used something that Josef called "bag-of-words" and was some sort of statistical matching algorithm.</p>

<p>We didn't pair it with any typing information. So if you had <code>Let $X$ be a scheme. ... blabla ... Hence $X$ is normal.</code> Then it wouldn't figure out that <code>normal</code> meant <code>scheme.normal</code> (if there was no occurence of the word <code>scheme</code> within the closest 10 words).</p>

<p>In fact, if <code>group</code> occured near by (for some reason), it would likely have a false match.</p>

<p>Ideally, we could get a version of the Ganesalingam–BL parser. But that seems socially impossible.</p>

<p>Yeah that would definitely be a boost, let me know if you ever try anything like this, this problem has been something I've wanted to try and do more on for a while.</p>
