<p>As we move on through mathematics we're running into interesting questions about universes. Scott Morrison has set up the category theory library so objects are in universe u and morphisms in universe v, and there are good mathematical reasons to keep the universes separate. This has annoying consequences, which Scott has done his best to work around in Lean 3, but one still has to sometimes write <code>blah.{v}</code> instead of <code>blah</code> just to help Lean on its way with unification.</p>
<p>Having talked to several other mathematicians about universes really, it has become pretty clear that everyone knows there's some sort of an issue with the set of all sets, but they really don't care about universes. </p>
<p>I think that what would make mathematicians happy would be the following interface: we just put <code>Type *</code> or <code>Sort *</code> for everything, we let Lean be as polymorphic as possible, we can put <code>blah.{*}</code> or just even <code>blah</code> and tell Lean to do the sensible thing, and at the end of the day if we ever work out the cohomology of the real numbers and it turns out that it is the trivial group in type Type 3 because three times in our argument we took a limit over a thing that wasn't a set, then we don't care but make a mental note that the ZFC people might want to add something here. Is this algorithm going to be available in Lean 4?</p>
