<p>I know very little about quadratic reciprocity and this proof, but for those who do, in your opinion, what should be the biggest nodes in terms of "mathematical importance", i.e. the "key steps"?</p>

<p>The key steps are polynomials of degree n over an integral domain have at most n roots, Lagrange's theorem in group theory, cyclicness of units of finite field, the fact that integers mod p are a field. After that it's more or less just annoying manipulations of products that have no relevance outside of this proof.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it's not quite true. It's really easy to have fun with, like you and I did. But the purpose of this software is to actually get information from the graph, either visually or in tables. And this is much harder.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 16 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/quadratic%20reciprocity%20graph/near/134068463):
<p>I think that Gauss knew all of the facts that Chris quoted when he formulated the law, but it took him years to find the proof. Perhaps because in some sense the proof isn't conceptual -- or at least the proofs Gauss found weren't. Now we can deduce it from more general reciprocity laws which do have conceptual proofs, but to formalise those proofs we need some basic algebraic number theory first (factorisation of ideals into prime ideals in the integers of a number field).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> quadratic reciprocity does not follow easily from these standard facts that Chris quoted. The hard part is putting everything together in a subtle way. I wonder how long a computer would take to prove it just given the standard facts. I suspect a long time. As Chris said, you end up doing some delicate counting with some intermediate lemmas that you never use again for anything else</p>

<p>I am not sure that Gauss's proofs of quadratic reciprocity gave us any understanding of why the theorem is true. The arguments are sufficiently elementary to be easily checkable by a third year undergraduate but at the end of the day it's a big motivationless computation of eg the number of dots in a rectangle counted in a weird way</p>

<p>But back to the point I've been thinking more about quadratic reciprocity. What insight does that stupid rectangle proof give you? It's of the form "divide the rectangle up into about 6 regions, prove some boring lemmas about the number of points in each region, add everything up, deduce quadratic reciprocity". I am not at all sure that it gives you any insight into why the theorem is true at all. Chris gave an excellent summary of the proof -- "invoke some standard lemmas and then do a completely unmotivated computation about an apparently unrelated rectangle, and it happens to drop out". Kenny -- you probably followed Toby's proof -- can you then give me a succinct one-line summary as to why an odd prime p is a square mod 13 if and only if 13 is a square mod p? That assertion on the face of it looks like the ramblings of a madman -- those statements clearly have nothing to do with each other. The proof is entirely non-constructive as well (of course -- actually computing the square root of 13 mod p is computationally hard if p is huge, whereas computing a square root of p mod 13 is trivial). Is the rectangle proof really a proof? I read it and read it, and I still have no idea "why" the theorem is true.</p>
<p>Looking at it now, that proof of quadratic reciprocity looks pretty much the same as the four colour theorem proof to me -- that proof goes something like: divide the problem up into around 2000 graphs, prove a lemma about each graph, put everything together. And yet people regard quadratic reciprocity as a brilliant thing and the 4 colour proof as something which gives no insight. Are we just being blinded by the fact that 6 is less than 2000?</p>

<p>Wasn't there some "one-sentence" proof which showed an equation (maybe writing a prime 1 mod 4 as the sum of two squares?) has a solution by exhibiting an involution on some set of tuples of integers whose fixed points were solutions to the equations, and then exhibiting a second involution on the same set which obviously had a unique fixed point (or maybe an odd number of them)</p>

<p>Yes this is the one I was thinking of. Nice!<br>
I wonder how many of these verifications could be done automatically with a tool like Z3. Obviously it wouldn't be able to do the steps which use the fact that p is prime, but those cases could be handled manually and then fed in as additional hypotheses.</p>
