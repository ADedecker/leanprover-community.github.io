<p>I found myself typing <code>\R^n</code> into Lean, and it complained. I am still learning a lot about the type class system. Would it make sense to have an instance of <code>has_pow Type \N</code>, or would this create some unforseen problems?</p>

<p>Good question. I will need this as well.</p>
