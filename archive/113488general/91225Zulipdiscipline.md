Although I have no time for doing Lean those days, I still try to roughly follow conversations here. I noticed that it becomes harder because we are returning to Gitter-like mess with interleaved conversations in one giant thread (mostly in "Fresh off the boat" for the last few days). I know I've also created some of this mess, but I think it would really help to try to be a tiny bit more disciplined.

do we care about having 10000 threads?

If each thread has only one message it's back to Gitter-mess

But if there are indeed roughly one topic per thread then it's fine

so too many threads is no good and too few threads is no good?

From the perspective of someone who only wants to quickly read after the battle, the goal is to be able to read topic by topic

Can I vote for a new stream "mathlib" (or "math" or "maffs") so that I can mute all those topics at once? :smiley:

that could do

Not only you can vote, I think you can DO it
