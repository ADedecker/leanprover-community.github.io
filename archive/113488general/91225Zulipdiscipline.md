<p>Although I have no time for doing Lean those days, I still try to roughly follow conversations here. I noticed that it becomes harder because we are returning to Gitter-like mess with interleaved conversations in one giant thread (mostly in "Fresh off the boat" for the last few days). I know I've also created some of this mess, but I think it would really help to try to be a tiny bit more disciplined.</p>

<p>do we care about having 10000 threads?</p>

<p>If each thread has only one message it's back to Gitter-mess</p>

<p>But if there are indeed roughly one topic per thread then it's fine</p>

<p>so too many threads is no good and too few threads is no good?</p>

<p>From the perspective of someone who only wants to quickly read after the battle, the goal is to be able to read topic by topic</p>

<p>Can I vote for a new stream "mathlib" (or "math" or "maffs") so that I can mute all those topics at once? <span class="emoji emoji-1f603" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>

<p>that could do</p>

<p>Not only you can vote, I think you can DO it</p>
