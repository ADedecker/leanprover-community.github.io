Has anybody tried `brew install lean` on macOS lately? I thought it had stagnated, but the [formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lean) is actually up to date with v3.4.1. I just installed it and `lean --version` worked just fine. Haven't done anything else, yet.

Does it install `elan`?

No.

I feel like that's the only thing it should install.

Well, there was discussion recently about installing `lean` from GitHub and not having `gmp` (https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1971), so I think it's important for some people to know that `brew install lean` might work just fine.
