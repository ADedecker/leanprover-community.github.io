<p>Has anybody tried <code>brew install lean</code> on macOS lately? I thought it had stagnated, but the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lean" target="_blank" title="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lean">formula</a> is actually up to date with v3.4.1. I just installed it and <code>lean --version</code> worked just fine. Haven't done anything else, yet.</p>

<p>Does it install <code>elan</code>?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>I feel like that's the only thing it should install.</p>

<p>Well, there was discussion recently about installing <code>lean</code> from GitHub and not having <code>gmp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1971" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1971">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1971</a>), so I think it's important for some people to know that <code>brew install lean</code> might work just fine.</p>
