<p>This is yet another type class issue. The temporary fix: <code>instance mpp : module (polynomial α) (polynomial α) := by apply_instance</code></p>

<p>So what is happening here? Making <code>mpp</code> an instance makes type class inference behave differently? Basically it finds it earlier? Could one use priorities to somehow fix this?</p>

<p>The logs are migraine inducing, so I don't have an exact answer. But basically yeah, if <code>mpp</code> is the last instance added it's the first one tried, and the resolution path avoids some very costly search path. It's possible a local priority change could fix this instance, and I don't think we ever systematically adopted this idea from Floris (which we should): <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more.20type.20class.20inference.20issues/near/167026105" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more.20type.20class.20inference.20issues/near/167026105">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/more.20type.20class.20inference.20issues/near/167026105</a></p>

<p>Thanks Rob for the quick fix!</p>

<p>Ah that makes sense. I agree about the migraine haha. I saw it doing some weird stuff like using <code>discrete_field.to_local_ring.to_comm_ring</code> instead of directly using that a field is  a commutative ring</p>

<p>Hi Casper, if you're working on polynomials, and struggling with timeouts, you might be interested in completing the work I started on the <code>decidable_eq</code> branch, stripping out all the decidability conditions from polynomials and multivariable polynomials. Unfortunately I haven't had time to finish, but I hope it's mostly downhill from where I got up to --- just fix the remaining errors!</p>

<p>I didn't realize you had already started this, I was going to propose it as a possible fix as well.</p>
