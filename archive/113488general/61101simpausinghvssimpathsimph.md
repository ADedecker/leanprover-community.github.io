On a few occasions, I've found that `simp at h, simp [h]` works when `simpa using h` does not. I thought the latter was intended to replace the former. Is this not the case?

They are not equivalent. `simpa using h` is equivalent to `simp at h |-, exact h`

in particular, `simp at h, simp [h]` may use `h` to rewrite in subterms, while `simpa` is just preparing to match it directly against the goal

This makes `simpa` less powerful but more controlled, especially when quantifiers get involved

Ah, okay. Thanks.

Sean -- do you fancy editing the simp docs to explain this? I never really feel on top of this subtlety so never feel equipped to change them to explain it. I am still at the stage where I just try random combinations of simp, simpa, simp!, `simp * at *` and just keep going until it works.

Just edit the community one I guess

Hmm, I don't know. I'm just looking at that document for the first time. I don't find it very easy to follow for reference, and I wouldn't know where to put what. I think Mario answering Zulip questions in a document would be better. :wink:

To make matters even more interesting, I have a goal that isn't solved by `by simp at h, simp [h]` but is solved by `by simp at h; simp; exact h` or `by simp at h; simp [h] {contextual := tt}` or `Î» x, by simpa using h x`. After `by simp at h; simp`, `h` and the goal look exactly the same (with `set_option pp.all true`). I'm not clear on why it can't be solved.
