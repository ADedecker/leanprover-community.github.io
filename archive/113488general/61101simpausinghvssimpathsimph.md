<p>On a few occasions, I've found that <code>simp at h, simp [h]</code> works when <code>simpa using h</code> does not. I thought the latter was intended to replace the former. Is this not the case?</p>

<p>They are not equivalent. <code>simpa using h</code> is equivalent to <code>simp at h |-, exact h</code></p>

<p>in particular, <code>simp at h, simp [h]</code> may use <code>h</code> to rewrite in subterms, while <code>simpa</code> is just preparing to match it directly against the goal</p>

<p>This makes <code>simpa</code> less powerful but more controlled, especially when quantifiers get involved</p>

<p>Ah, okay. Thanks.</p>

<p>Sean -- do you fancy editing the simp docs to explain this? I never really feel on top of this subtlety so never feel equipped to change them to explain it. I am still at the stage where I just try random combinations of simp, simpa, simp!, <code>simp * at *</code> and just keep going until it works.</p>

<p>Just edit the community one I guess</p>

<p>Hmm, I don't know. I'm just looking at that document for the first time. I don't find it very easy to follow for reference, and I wouldn't know where to put what. I think Mario answering Zulip questions in a document would be better. <span class="emoji emoji-1f609" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>To make matters even more interesting, I have a goal that isn't solved by <code>by simp at h, simp [h]</code> but is solved by <code>by simp at h; simp; exact h</code> or <code>by simp at h; simp [h] {contextual := tt}</code> or <code>Î» x, by simpa using h x</code>. After <code>by simp at h; simp</code>, <code>h</code> and the goal look exactly the same (with <code>set_option pp.all true</code>). I'm not clear on why it can't be solved.</p>
