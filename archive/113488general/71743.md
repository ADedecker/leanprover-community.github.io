I accidentally discovered that `//` seems to have some special treatment in the parser. It gives a "command expected" error if I try to use it as notation. Does it do something?

```lean
infix `//`:70 := (/)
example : 5 // 5 = 1 := rfl
```
Works for me.  Can you post a minimum failing counterexample?

```lean
notation a `+/` b := a
#check (1 +/ 2)                 -- ok

notation a `//` b := a
#check (1 // 2)                 -- errors
```

You're inheriting the precedence of `//` in the subtype notation, which is zero. This is fine for subtypes, since it's in a context surrounded by braces, but for your notation you should give an explicit precedence like Gabriel did.

Oh, I see. Interesting.
