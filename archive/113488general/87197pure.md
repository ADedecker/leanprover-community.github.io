what is `pure`?

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 21:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135059948):
It means non-constructive

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 02 2018 at 21:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135060057):
eh, more details?

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Oct 02 2018 at 21:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135060084):
`pure : A -> F A` is usually the unit in a monad `F`. Sometimes its called `return`. Instances are the singleton list, finset, multiset, set. Or for tactics its the tactic returning a value.

So what would it be, in the context of topology?

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061165):
the pure filter?

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061173):
does it have type `filter a`?

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 02 2018 at 22:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061230):
yes

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 02 2018 at 22:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061255):
```lean

  singleton_subset_iff.2 h₁

maybe it doesn't

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 02 2018 at 22:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061266):
it has type `α → filter α`

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061279):
Ok, `pure x` is the filter of all sets containing `x`

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 02 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061350):
so it's just the principal filter?

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061385):
yes

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061388):
of the singleton x

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061411):
it's more specialized than `principal`

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 02 2018 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/pure/near/135061450):
Let me google this for you

Kenny did you read the stuff about monads in Programming In Lean? It is very accessible.
