<p>If <code>include blah</code> occurs in my current namespace, is there a way to make a special definition which doesn't take <code>blah</code> as an argument?</p>

<p><code>omit blah</code></p>

<p>and then reinclude</p>

<p>awesome cheers!</p>

<p>how about turning a <code>list Î±</code> into an <code>expr</code>?</p>

<p>I think <code>reflect</code> is what you want?</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>Has anyone ever gotten the error <code>VM does not have code for 'xyz.abc'</code> after trying to use something they <code>environment.add</code>ed?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 29 2018 at 13:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Un-including%20an%20include/near/134879479):
<p>The only time I get that error is when I've accidentally used <code>theorem</code> to make a definition</p>

<p>it turned out to be a really obscure problem, where if you call user_attribute.get_param with someone who doesn't have the attribute set, the vm un-gracefully shoots you down without a catchable <code>fail</code></p>

#### [ Keeley Hoek (Sep 29 2018 at 14:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Un-including%20an%20include/near/134881168):
<p>If this ever comes up for anyone else, <code>environment.add</code> is a little messed up if you want to later add attributes<br>
Instead use <code>tactic.add_decl</code> (both are implemented in C++)</p>

<p>Are you sure? <code>get_param</code> has issues because it uses <code>eval_expr</code> which is kind of broken. Try <code>get_param_untyped</code> instead to see if it crashes uglily, still</p>
