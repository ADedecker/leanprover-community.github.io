If `include blah` occurs in my current namespace, is there a way to make a special definition which doesn't take `blah` as an argument?

`omit blah`

and then reinclude

awesome cheers!

how about turning a `list Î±` into an `expr`?

I think `reflect` is what you want?

Sweet!

Has anyone ever gotten the error `VM does not have code for 'xyz.abc'` after trying to use something they `environment.add`ed?

The only time I get that error is when I've accidentally used `theorem` to make a definition

it turned out to be a really obscure problem, where if you call user_attribute.get_param with someone who doesn't have the attribute set, the vm un-gracefully shoots you down without a catchable `fail`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Keeley Hoek (Sep 29 2018 at 14:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Un-including%20an%20include/near/134881168):
If this ever comes up for anyone else, `environment.add` is a little messed up if you want to later add attributes
Instead use `tactic.add_decl` (both are implemented in C++)

```
Are you sure? `get_param` has issues because it uses `eval_expr` which is kind of broken. Try `get_param_untyped` instead to see if it crashes uglily, still
