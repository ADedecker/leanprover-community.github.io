I am a complete newbie when it comes to tactic writing. Here is a request for a tactic, and I have no idea how realistic it is. Suppose I have an isomorphism `h : X ≅ Y` in some category `C`. And suppose I have some other term `foo : bar X`, then I would like to have a tactic `cerw` (category-`erw`) that tries to figure out if `bar` is some sort of `category_theory.functor.obj` and if so, replaces `X` with `Y`.
I realise this request is a bit vague. I would be happy to flesh out the details.

HI Johan,

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 18 2018 at 21:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147929239):
I started writing this, as `iso_induction`.

This is intended as my start of an answer to all our questions about transport of structure.

It is not at all done, but it is certainly doable, and I would love to do it!

Have a look at https://github.com/semorrison/lean-category-theory/blob/master/src/category_theory/iso_induction.lean

for the idea

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 18 2018 at 21:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147929468):
It is not quite that same as `iso_rw`, but the same tooling would be required to make that work.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 18 2018 at 21:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147929531):
`iso_induction` takes a hypotheses `X \iso Y`, and tries to replace all appearances of `X` with `Y`, by writing everything in a form where `X` appears as the argument of a functor.

Cool. That's going to be very useful!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 19 2018 at 06:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147946650):
I am afraid that `monoid.ext` will be considered intollerable abuse of the type class system.

@**Johan Commelin**, what's wrong with `monoid.ext`?
```
@[extensionality] lemma monoid.ext {α : Type u} (m n : monoid α)
  (mul : ∀ x y : α, (by haveI := m; exact x * y) = (by haveI := n; exact x * y)) : m = n :=
```

looks good to me

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 19 2018 at 09:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951701):
Is it the two different uses of `haveI` that you're worried about?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 19 2018 at 09:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951704):
Aah, wait. You aren't actually asking that there are two instances of `monoid α`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 19 2018 at 09:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951707):
I read to fast.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Nov 19 2018 at 09:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951709):
No, no square brackets for this lemma!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 19 2018 at 09:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951792):
do you have groupoids? that's an obvious thing to prove about `isos`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 19 2018 at 09:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cerw/near/147951911):
also it's not clear to me why `monoid_transport` isn't proven directly and it becomes the map part of `monoid_type_constructor`
