Let's play a new game: each time someone opens a PR and is asked for style corrections, we check whether https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/style.md and https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/naming.md already have them. If not we open something like https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/95

Good idea! How do we pick a winner?
