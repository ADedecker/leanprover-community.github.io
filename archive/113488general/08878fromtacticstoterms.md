Even though I'm beginning to understand a bit of the `meta`-world, I still don't fully comprehend the tactic monad. For example: is it possible to extract a concrete term from a `begin ... end`-block?

Ok, I found `format_result` in Ed's recent docs on `meta`.

The problem is that I don't see any output anywhere, when I plug it into some `begin ... end` block.

You'll need to `trace` it?

Hmm. Good idea. But `trace tactic.format_result` gives the error
```lean
failed to synthesize type class instance for
‚ä¢ has_to_tactic_format (tactic format)
```

sounds ironic

`trace_state` usually prints a trace.

@**Johan Commelin** See `tactic.trace_result`
