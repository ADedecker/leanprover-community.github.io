<p>I've been playing around with displaying and interacting with Lean files on the web using "Observable notebooks" recently. See this page for a demonstration:</p>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-1-some-sums" target="_blank" title="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-1-some-sums">https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-1-some-sums</a></p>
<p>Basically, the notebook displays some simple Lean code in several embedded Lean editors with lots of markdown / LaTeX explanation around them. You can click to the left of any of the "cells" to see their Javascript source code. You can write and edit notebooks like this directly in your browser if you create a free account on <a href="http://observablehq.com" target="_blank" title="http://observablehq.com">observablehq.com</a> by e.g. signing in with Github.</p>
<p>One feature I rigged into the Lean editor cells is that they pass their messages from the Lean server back to Javascript. Since Observable notebooks work like spreadsheets, I could make "Lean-driven" graphics like the ones in the following notebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-2-bees-and-cars" target="_blank" title="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-2-bees-and-cars">https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/fibonacci-formalized-2-bees-and-cars</a></p>
<p>Try changing the numbers in the <code>#eval</code> statements in the editors above the family tree graphic and the car configuration graphic and seeing how they change. (Don't make them too large or else browser Lean will run out of memory). </p>
<p>It'd be interesting to see what else this could be used for!</p>
<p>I wrote a little bit more about Observable notebooks and how you can write notebooks like these at the end of the first notebook above, but feel free to ask here if you have any questions.</p>
