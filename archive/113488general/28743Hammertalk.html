<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> I am sorry I missed your hammer talk.  I look forward to seeing the video later.  In the meantime I read the slides and have some questions (which might have been answered in the Q&amp;A).  First, I want to say that this looks great!</p>
<ul>
<li>How useful would it be to improve the premise selection algorithm (using possibly a trained model)?  Do you think that would be a benefit or is TF-IDF-based premise selection currently good enough?</li>
<li>I didn't realize that Lean tactics could call C++ code.  Is this hacked into the Lean source code?  How easy would it be to swap out your tactic with another custom tactic using a mix of Lean and C++ code (or all C++ code)?  (For example, any neural based tactic would probably need to call TensorFlow or PyTouch.)</li>
<li>Less extreme, how easy would it be to swap your premise selector with another?</li>
<li>Finally, how easy would it be to extract the information used by the hammer?  Specifically, there could be some nice datasets that could come out of this.  The one I have in mind is (a) the statements of all the theorems you attempted to prove, (b) the available premises to use for that theorem, (c) the premises selected by TF-IDF cosign similarity, (d) the ones used by the SMT solver, and (e) the ones used by the other tested tactics (like library_search).  (And if possible and easy, (f) the ones used in the original proof.)</li>
</ul>
