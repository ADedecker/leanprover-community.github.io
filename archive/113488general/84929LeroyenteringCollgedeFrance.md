<p>Formal methods in CS continue to get more and more exposure in French academia. Remember that earlier this year, Antoine Petit, a formal method expert, became head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_national_de_la_recherche_scientifique" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_national_de_la_recherche_scientifique">CNRS</a>, the French national research agency. A few days ago, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France">Collège de France</a> hired Xavier Leroy as a new permanent professor. There is nothing higher than being a professor at Collège de France in the in French academic system. Leroy is one of the main people behind OCaml and CompCert (Coq certified C compiler). People understanding French can watch his "inaugural lecture"  <a href="http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/xavier-leroy/inaugural-lecture-2018-11-15-18h00.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/xavier-leroy/inaugural-lecture-2018-11-15-18h00.htm">http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/xavier-leroy/inaugural-lecture-2018-11-15-18h00.htm</a> A general audience lecture about programming languages and formal methods. The actual talk begins about 8 minutes into the video.</p>
