It's really too bad that we can't see how the goals change before / after semicolons. </p>
<p>I made a half-hearted attempt to see whether there was any way to implement this for 3.5.x, but I didn't get very far. I did manage to figure out that the relevant code is around <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/0d2b2697d163416d759f52e417d5579685e01d9e/library/init/meta/tactic.lean#L1029" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/0d2b2697d163416d759f52e417d5579685e01d9e/library/init/meta/tactic.lean#L1029">here</a>, but I think I got stuck when I couldn't figure out how to get the cursor position to change the tactic state display using <code>save_info</code> (?).</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for this?</p>

<p>I would actually be curious to see how the tactic state reporting after <code>,</code> in <code>rw [a, b]</code> works, since that's unlike any other tactic; maybe we can generalize that to other contexts</p>

<p>Yeah, I remember trying to understand that as well, I think it's around <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/dacb70b83853b23b2fc20afdc4d5888cee0d4363/library/init/meta/interactive.lean#L358" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/dacb70b83853b23b2fc20afdc4d5888cee0d4363/library/init/meta/interactive.lean#L358">here</a>. I guess I should study <code>parser</code>.</p>
