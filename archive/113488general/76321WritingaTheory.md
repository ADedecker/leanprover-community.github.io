<p>Dear friends, I am new in Lean and I want to write a theory. I have read logic and proof tutorial and now I want to build my own theories. I understand that they will be written in Lean Programming language. Does anyone have a simple ready theory as guide and can provide me the steps to compile it and make it available to new theories?</p>

<p>Are you looking for help in how to make some Lean code open source and usable by others or how to structure your Lean to present a nice interface?</p>
