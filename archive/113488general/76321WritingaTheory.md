Dear friends, I am new in Lean and I want to write a theory. I have read logic and proof tutorial and now I want to build my own theories. I understand that they will be written in Lean Programming language. Does anyone have a simple ready theory as guide and can provide me the steps to compile it and make it available to new theories?

@**Regivan Santiago** Have you worked through [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/)?

You should read it. It's great.

I will. So this is the first step.

Are you looking for help in how to make some Lean code open source and usable by others or how to structure your Lean to present a nice interface?
