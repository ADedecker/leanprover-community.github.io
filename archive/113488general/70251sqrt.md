<p>Curiosity provoked by Kevin's comment elsewhere: Could sqrt be computable?<br>
Obviously there is some potential problem near 0, but my feeling is that it could be worked out, but I'm not 100% sure.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Aug 01 2018 at 22:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739328):
<p>I think classical reals are noncomputable from start to end</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Aug 01 2018 at 22:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739418):
<p>The equality <code>(sqrt x)^2 = x</code> would be non decidable</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739632):
<p>I think you can at least add Cauchy sequences constructively, but I guess there's no real point because there is no information you can get out of an element of ‚Ñù</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739756):
<p>Pretty much every continuous function is computably definable</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739766):
<p>but it's more work</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739778):
<p>A real number is data, you can compute with it if you want</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739801):
<p>But I have to compute a function which is constant on the equivalence class, right? what could I compute?</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739805):
<p>besides other real numbers</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739815):
<p>any constant expression, like pi</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Aug 01 2018 at 22:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739999):
<p>We have a team working hard on constructing pi :-) </p>
<p>The main problem at the minute is that nobody can be bothered to type in the proof that a power series is continuous within its radius of convergence :-/</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740114):
<p>meh, I went for a low tech proof of continuity of exp in metamath</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740136):
<p>it's easy to bound <code>x+1 &lt; e^x &lt; 1/(1-x)</code> and use the squeeze lemma</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740185):
<p>(wait, that's differentiability. Continuity is probably even easier)</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740288):
<p>Oh yes, at one point I wanted continuity of the sum of a Cauchy sequence of bounded continuous functions also. I was kind of hoping Johannes would make it magically appear.</p>
