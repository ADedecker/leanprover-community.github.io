Curiosity provoked by Kevin's comment elsewhere: Could sqrt be computable?
Obviously there is some potential problem near 0, but my feeling is that it could be worked out, but I'm not 100% sure.

I think classical reals are noncomputable from start to end

#### [Patrick Massot (Aug 01 2018 at 22:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739418):
The equality `(sqrt x)^2 = x` would be non decidable

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739632):
I think you can at least add Cauchy sequences constructively, but I guess there's no real point because there is no information you can get out of an element of ‚Ñù

Pretty much every continuous function is computably definable

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739766):
but it's more work

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739778):
A real number is data, you can compute with it if you want

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739801):
But I have to compute a function which is constant on the equivalence class, right? what could I compute?

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739805):
besides other real numbers

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739815):
any constant expression, like pi

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 01 2018 at 22:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130739999):
We have a team working hard on constructing pi :-) 

The main problem at the minute is that nobody can be bothered to type in the proof that a power series is continuous within its radius of convergence :-/

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740114):
meh, I went for a low tech proof of continuity of exp in metamath

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740136):
it's easy to bound `x+1 < e^x < 1/(1-x)` and use the squeeze lemma

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 01 2018 at 22:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740185):
(wait, that's differentiability. Continuity is probably even easier)

#### [Reid Barton (Aug 01 2018 at 22:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/sqrt/near/130740288):
Oh yes, at one point I wanted continuity of the sum of a Cauchy sequence of bounded continuous functions also. I was kind of hoping Johannes would make it magically appear.
