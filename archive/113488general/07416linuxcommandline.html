<p>I downloaded the 3.4.2 tar.gz image of lean and unpacked it into a directory, which contains only bin, include, and lib. In bin there is an executable called 'lean' which apparently does nothing. I've used lean in the browser and want a command line version on my linux box. <br>
Can someone point me to instructions to actually run this executable? Google searches have turned up nothing.</p>
