Is there an idiomatic way to flatten a `list (option A)` to a `list A`?

`join (to_list o l)`

okay

#### [Scott Morrison (Apr 16 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/idiom/near/125141430):
err.. what? What are your `o` and `l`?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 16 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/idiom/near/125141433):
oh, that was composition but it should be map

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 16 2018 at 11:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/idiom/near/125141434):
or you can use bind

`l.bind option.to_list` should work
