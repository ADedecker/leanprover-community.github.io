<p>Not yet. I'm still trying to see what it is</p>

<p>i asked earlier and was told just proving the central limit theorem was a massive 6000 line development in isabelle</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> it's a brand new way of constructing free groups</p>

<p>Can you call it <code>free_group</code> then?</p>

<p>it isn't the free group</p>

<p>now suppose I want to formalize the statement of the curse of dimensionality, i.e. if you have a bunch of variables in R^n that are iid, most points in the sphere are located near the surface. that would be months of work, hah</p>

<p>and it would probably take me twice as long since I'm not named Mario :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span>  The boring answer might be <code>free_group_aux</code>. But a nicer name might express what it does for <code>free_group</code></p>
