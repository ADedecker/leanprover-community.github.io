<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> Assia asked me why we now use [ring R] [add_comm_group M] [module R M] instead of bunding everything into the module structure. As I recall, this decision had to do with type class problems e.g. with expressions <code>x + y</code> where there is no trace of the ring structure, making it hard to find the right module, though not hard to find the relative group. Do you have a better explanation?</p>

<p>Just to remark that we also use <code>[comm_ring R] [topological_space R] [topological_ring R]</code> instead of bundling everything into the topological ring structure. But is this a different issue?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> I think it is to support the possibility that <code>M</code>is a module over several different rings. In such cases you wouldn't want the additive group structure to change, but only the scalar multiplication. Hence the two step process.</p>

<p>Before this refactor, we had a setup where <code>R</code> was an <code>out_param</code>. (And it still didn't really support having two scalar rings on the same <code>M</code>, IIRC.) But this out_param caused lots of headaches and issues with type-class search. At the time I was even more of a newbie then I am nowadays, so I really didn't understand what was going on. All I knew was that it was impossible to use modules in any non-trivial way. Then Mario and Kenny refactored it, and nowadays they are quite pleasant to use.</p>

<p>Of course want could define <code>Module R</code> (and in fact this has recently been done by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="201572">@Robert Spencer</span>), and write <code>M : Module R</code>. This has the benefit that you can (and we have) a category structure on <code>Module R</code>. But the problem is that it makes it harder to talk about <code>\C</code> as an <code>\R</code>-module, etc... Also changing the scalar ring is not so transparent anymore.</p>

<p>Thanks, Johan. I'll pass that along.</p>
