<p>Thurston has an interesting paper (Thurston, William P. "On Proof and Progress in Mathematics",Bull. AMS, v30 n2 April 1994) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf</a>) on page 3 he caricatures what mathematicians do as:</p>
<p>D. mathematicians start from a few basic mathematical structures and a collection of axioms "given" about those structures, that</p>
<p>T. There are various important questions to be answered about these structures that can be stated as formal mathematical propositions, and</p>
<p>P. the task of the mathematician is to seek a deductive pathway from the axioms to the propositions or to their denials.</p>
<p>All, in all, an interesting paper to read.</p>

<p>Though it seems to me that this is the model which he aims to criticize in that paper, and he argues in the rest of the paper that mathematical understanding is something very different from this so-called definition-theorem-proof (DTP) model of mathematics.</p>

<p>Indeed, he goes on to say "I am NOT criticizing the mathematical study of formal proofs, nor am I criticizing people who put energy into making mathematical arguments more explicit and more formal."</p>

<p>He also says "There are people working hard on the project of actually formalizing parts of mathematics by computer, with actual formally correct formal deductions. I think this is a very big but very worthwhile project."</p>

<p>But he also stresses that communication is central to the game. As a rabid follower of Knuth's Literate Programming path I feel that it is important to document the theorems with an emphasis on communication. The bare Lean code is not sufficient.</p>
