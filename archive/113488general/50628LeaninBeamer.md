How do people put Lean snippets inside LaTeX Beamer slides? Is there a `listings` syntax highlighting somewhere?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 16:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154245022):
Hum, google answered https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/extras/latex/lstlean.md

I'd still be happy to read any comment of advice on this topic

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 03 2019 at 16:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154245477):
I've switched to `minted` + luatex + https://bitbucket.org/leanprover/pygments-main for better Unicode support (and better highlighting, I think?). But setting it up isn't trivial, I wouldn't bother if you're happy with `listings`.

I just discovered listings doesn't seem to like XeLaTeX so I'm not happy at all

Sebastian, do you have setup instruction somewhere?

if there any Lean-specific issue, or should general documentation apply?

appart from using the above fork of pygment I mean

No, the `minted` documentation should work fine

Just make sure you don't have the standard pygments installed, I think. It's been a while.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248529):
I can't get any unicode character to work :sad:

I don't know anything about Xelatex. Does your monospace font support them?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248714):
It's the same with LuaLaTeX, inside or outside Beamer

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248759):
Do you have any example of a working TeX file?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 03 2019 at 17:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248769):
I.e. does it work in `\verb`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 03 2019 at 17:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248814):
This is what I do for unsupported characters:
```
\usepackage{newunicodechar}
\newfontfamily{\freeserif}{DejaVu Sans}
\newunicodechar{‚Ñï}{\freeserif{‚Ñï}}
\newunicodechar{‚Ñù}{\freeserif{‚Ñù}}
...
```

It doesn't work with `\verb`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154248908):
But it works with your extra input

Great

@**Patrick Massot** how important is it to use xelatex or lualatex? I use something similar to the following setup with just pdflatex, and it works for me including unicode: https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/cf74935acdcc9f3133fe1aabaace68f0

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154249308):
I use them to be able to use [unicode-math](https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math)

I didn't know you could specify an aspect ratio to Beamer! Now I expect the organizers to tell me what is the aspect ratio of your video beamer!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes H√∂lzl (Jan 03 2019 at 17:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154249635):
Monday to Wednesday we are in a room called "Agora 1", I never was in this room, but "Agora 3" has 4:3. I can check tomorrow. @**Rob Lewis** do you know what kind of projection we will have?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Jan 03 2019 at 17:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250098):
Uh, I assume the same as Agora 3. I was also going to check on the whiteboard and projector inputs tomorrow.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250134):
Hum, I tried to sed-convert my unicode mapping list to Sebastian's trick, but the 80's fought back: `! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250244):
Thanks Johannes and Rob! Don't worry too much about that aspect ratio thing, it's almost certainly traditional

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250256):
@**Sebastian Ullrich** do you have such a trick for calligraphic letters?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 03 2019 at 17:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250322):
Something like this?
```
\newunicodechar{ùìû}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}}
```

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250369):
I tried that, but then I get a red rectangle around the letter, as we somtimes see on Zulip. I guess this comes from Pygment though.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250460):
Oh, I also have it on the left pointing arrow from backward rewrite. Could it mean I don't use the right version of pygment? Is there an easy test here?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250884):
Maybe https://bitbucket.org/leanprover/pygments-main/src/50aee5370b53b5d05a2329d5e50ffdce83660d87/pygments/lexers/theorem.py?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#theorem.py-448 needs updating?

Riight. You'll want this repo instead... I think https://bitbucket.org/derkha/pygments-main

I see pygments development has actually resumed, I'm surprised. So maybe we can even upstream the changes.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 18:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154251542):
That would be soooo nice, especially for Zulip

@**Gabriel Ebner** are you sure you fixed the caligraphic letter issue?

Indeed it looks like activity resumed two weeks ago. They have only 83 PR to merge know, it's not even twice as many as mathlib!

@**Patrick Massot**  No, I just fixed some highlighting issues (keywords, etc.).  And this was mainly for sphinx (which uses the html backend).  The calligraphic letters are only a problem with the latex backend (they work fine with html).

I think you just need to add enough `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter`:
```latex
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{1D49E}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{C}}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{1D4A5}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{J}}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{1D49F}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{D}}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2964}{\ensuremath{\Rightarrow}} %FIXME
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{3A0}{\ensuremath{\Pi}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2200}{\ensuremath{\forall}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{3C0}{\ensuremath{\pi}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{226B}{>>} % FIXME
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{22D9}{>>>} % FIXME
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{226A}{<<} % FIXME
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{27F6}{\ensuremath{\to}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{27E8}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{27E9}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{3BB}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2245}{\ensuremath{\cong}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2190}{\ensuremath{\leftarrow}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{27F9}{\ensuremath{\Rightarrow}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2192}{\ensuremath{\longrightarrow}} % FIXME
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{3B9}{\ensuremath{\iota}}

\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{3B2}{\ensuremath{\beta}}
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2081}{\ensuremath{{}_1}}

```
See https://gist.github.com/gebner/5f0026666e8758d00e87a2eb352f7a43  (This uses the `pygmentize -f latex` output directly).  The same trick probably works with minted as well.

It's pretty sad that not even luatex or xetex implement any kind of font fallback. It just works in our editors, damnit.

 There actually is some lean specific doc here: https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/syntax_highlight_in_latex.md which has worked well for me at least.
