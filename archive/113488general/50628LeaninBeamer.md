<p>How do people put Lean snippets inside LaTeX Beamer slides? Is there a <code>listings</code> syntax highlighting somewhere?</p>

<p>I'd still be happy to read any comment of advice on this topic</p>

<p>I've switched to <code>minted</code> + luatex + <a href="https://bitbucket.org/leanprover/pygments-main" target="_blank" title="https://bitbucket.org/leanprover/pygments-main">https://bitbucket.org/leanprover/pygments-main</a> for better Unicode support (and better highlighting, I think?). But setting it up isn't trivial, I wouldn't bother if you're happy with <code>listings</code>.</p>

<p>I just discovered listings doesn't seem to like XeLaTeX so I'm not happy at all</p>

<p>No, the <code>minted</code> documentation should work fine</p>

<p>Just make sure you don't have the standard pygments installed, I think. It's been a while.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about Xelatex. Does your monospace font support them?</p>

<p>It's the same with LuaLaTeX, inside or outside Beamer</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> how important is it to use xelatex or lualatex? I use something similar to the following setup with just pdflatex, and it works for me including unicode: <a href="https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/cf74935acdcc9f3133fe1aabaace68f0" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/cf74935acdcc9f3133fe1aabaace68f0">https://gist.github.com/johoelzl/cf74935acdcc9f3133fe1aabaace68f0</a></p>

<p>I didn't know you could specify an aspect ratio to Beamer! Now I expect the organizers to tell me what is the aspect ratio of your video beamer!</p>

#### [ Johannes H√∂lzl (Jan 03 2019 at 17:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154249635):
<p>Monday to Wednesday we are in a room called "Agora 1", I never was in this room, but "Agora 3" has 4:3. I can check tomorrow. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> do you know what kind of projection we will have?</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 03 2019 at 17:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250098):
<p>Uh, I assume the same as Agora 3. I was also going to check on the whiteboard and projector inputs tomorrow.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250134):
<p>Hum, I tried to sed-convert my unicode mapping list to Sebastian's trick, but the 80's fought back: <code>! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].</code></p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250244):
<p>Thanks Johannes and Rob! Don't worry too much about that aspect ratio thing, it's almost certainly traditional</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> do you have such a trick for calligraphic letters?</p>

<p>Something like this?</p>

<p>I tried that, but then I get a red rectangle around the letter, as we somtimes see on Zulip. I guess this comes from Pygment though.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 03 2019 at 17:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Lean%20in%20Beamer/near/154250460):
<p>Oh, I also have it on the left pointing arrow from backward rewrite. Could it mean I don't use the right version of pygment? Is there an easy test here?</p>

<p>Indeed it looks like activity resumed two weeks ago. They have only 83 PR to merge know, it's not even twice as many as mathlib!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>  No, I just fixed some highlighting issues (keywords, etc.).  And this was mainly for sphinx (which uses the html backend).  The calligraphic letters are only a problem with the latex backend (they work fine with html).</p>
