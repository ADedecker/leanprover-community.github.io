<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> How can I recover the old behavior of <code>obviously</code> which did not trace the steps it took?<br>
Perhaps the replaceable thing ought to be called <code>cat_tactic</code> or something, and <code>obviously</code> should return to its old behavior?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>, I've silenced the trace messages from obviously.</p>

<p>Moreover, yesterday Mario and I overhauled tidy from top to bottom. The code is much shorter and saner now. :-)</p>
