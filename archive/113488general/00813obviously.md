@**Scott Morrison** How can I recover the old behavior of `obviously` which did not trace the steps it took?
Perhaps the replaceable thing ought to be called `cat_tactic` or something, and `obviously` should return to its old behavior?

@**Reid Barton**, I've silenced the trace messages from obviously.

Moreover, yesterday Mario and I overhauled tidy from top to bottom. The code is much shorter and saner now. :-)
