Suppose I have an assumption
```lean
h : ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 → (∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ N → ∀ (y : α), dist (F n y) (f y) ≤ ε)
```
and a goal
```lean
∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 → (∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ N → ∀ (y : α), y ∈ ball x 1 → dist (F n y) (f y) ≤ ε)
```
The goal is a trivial consequence of `h` (there are more assumptions in the goal than in `h`). I can prove it by hand doing the `intros`/`rcases` dance, but I did not find a tactic that would do it out of the box. Did I miss something?

`tidy` can do these sometimes

Also, there's `rintros` now :smile:

Poor `tidy` is completely lost when there are real numbers: it unfolds the Cauchy sequences definition, and asks for new goals looking like
```lean
dist (F n y) (f y) ≤ quot.mk setoid.r ⟨ε_val, ε_property⟩
```

I don't see why one can't just prove it by hand. It isn't like it's very complicated

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 19 2018 at 22:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tauto?/near/136136609):
but yes, I agree there should be a tactic that doesn't only take `iff` things as argument

Because proving things by hand don't scale

#### [Patrick Massot (Oct 19 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tauto?/near/136136663):
We want thousands of those trivial proofs

Isabelle proof: `using h by blast` :)

That still two words of noise, but it's getting close to acceptable
