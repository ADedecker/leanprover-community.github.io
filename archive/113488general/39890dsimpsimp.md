I think I set a new personal record:
`by dsimp [is_limit.equiv, adjunction.cone_equivalence]; simp; dsimp; simp`

Can we make a `dsimp` and `simp` all in one tactic.

Yay, and I'm happy seeing `is_limit.equiv` being used moments after I wrote it (again). :-)

@**Scott Morrison|110087** I think we should expand the category theory library

instead of saying that Lean is not ready for it

Absolutely, I agree it should be expanded massively.
