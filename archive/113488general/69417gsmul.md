<p>Now that we have overloaded <code>â€¢</code> with the scalar multiplication in modules and <code>gsmul</code>, how are we going to tell Lean that I want to use <code>gsmul</code>?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 09 2018 at 16:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124838630):
<p>(note that things get more complicated as there is a coercion from integers to rings)</p>

<p><code>has_neg</code> -&gt; <code>has_neg</code> not <code>has_inv</code>?</p>

<p>that's in group.lean</p>

<p><code>gsmul</code> is additive Group Scalar MULtiplication?</p>

<p>yes</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124863514):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> are you trying to fix it?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864636):
<p>I already did earlier today</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864637):
<p>by "are you trying" I don't necessarily mean this particular moment</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864638):
<p>I asked because I saw your commit</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864639):
<p>so what is the solution now?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 03:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864681):
<p>No more overloading - <code>has_scalar.smul</code> is the global bullet notation, which is used in modules, while <code>gsmul</code> has no notation unless you declare it locally</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864687):
<p>nice</p>
