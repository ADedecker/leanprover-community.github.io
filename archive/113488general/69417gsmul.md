Now that we have overloaded `â€¢` with the scalar multiplication in modules and `gsmul`, how are we going to tell Lean that I want to use `gsmul`?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 09 2018 at 16:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124838630):
(note that things get more complicated as there is a coercion from integers to rings)

Just trying to figure out what is going on here.

```lean
/- map constructors -/
attribute [to_additive has_add.mk] has_mul.mk
attribute [to_additive has_zero.mk] has_one.mk
attribute [to_additive has_neg.mk] has_neg.mk
```

`has_neg` -> `has_neg` not `has_inv`?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 09 2018 at 17:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124840496):
that's in group.lean

`gsmul` is additive Group Scalar MULtiplication?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 09 2018 at 17:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124840677):
yes

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124863514):
@**Mario Carneiro** are you trying to fix it?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864636):
I already did earlier today

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864637):
by "are you trying" I don't necessarily mean this particular moment

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864638):
I asked because I saw your commit

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864639):
so what is the solution now?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 10 2018 at 03:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864681):
No more overloading - `has_scalar.smul` is the global bullet notation, which is used in modules, while `gsmul` has no notation unless you declare it locally

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 10 2018 at 03:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/gsmul/near/124864687):
nice
