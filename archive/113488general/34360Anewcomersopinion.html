<p>I am still very new to lean but I have been browsing through mathlib these days. I would like to share one obstacle I observed that an ordinary mathematician would face when trying to understanding lean code. That is, <strong>abbreviation of mathematical terms</strong>.  For example, look at this definition of an outer measure:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>structure outer_measure (α : Type*) :=
(measure_of : set α → ennreal)
(empty : measure_of ∅ = 0)
(mono : ∀{s₁ s₂}, s₁ ⊆ s₂ → measure_of s₁ ≤ measure_of s₂)
(Union_nat : ∀(s:ℕ → set α), measure_of (⋃i, s i) ≤ (∑i, measure_of (s i)))
</pre></div>


<p>In this case, since I am familiar with the definition, I can guess that ennreal = extented non-negative reals, mono=monotonicity, Union_nat= countable subadditivity. But others might get it. Moreover, sometimes the abbreviation is long and odd looking and it's hard to guess its meaning. I understand that abbreviation can shorten the code, but I would argue that in the statement of major definitions or theorems, it worthes avoiding abbreviation in order to increase the readability to ordinary mathematicians.</p>

<p>I can't see it in mathlib. But even if so, there are still many examples of abbreviation causing confusion.</p>

<p>The naming follows a somewhat rigid convention in order to make it easier to guess the names of theorems. Mathematicians are not globally consistent in how things get named, so if you try to follow that kind of pattern you end up confusing even yourself after a while</p>

<p>For the particular case of fields of <code>outer_measure</code>, I wouldn't associate much to the particular names. It's just a bunch of axioms</p>

<p>For example in most presentations of, say, vector spaces you find in textbooks it's just a list of equalities. You can give them names, but they aren't that helpful</p>

<p>It's true that it is somewhat of an idiolect that you have to learn, but there is no way around that. Using mathematician naming for the things that mathematicians bothered to name would just make it a more inconsistent language</p>

<p>With a version of the perfectoid project up until a few weeks ago, we had specifically tried to make our definition of a perfectoid space readable by mathematicians. More recently we've been trying to actually get it to compile, and now it is probably less readable (and still doesn't compile), however it is still pretty readable, indeed it's more readable than it was yesterday morning, and one high priority issue after we get it working will be to make it better readable.</p>

<p>Perfectoid ring is not bad really. Note that one difference is that perfectoid_ring is written by mathematicians, and outer_measure was written by computer scientists.</p>

<p>Johan says outer measure isn't really that bad either -- there is obviously an initial learning curve when it comes to the basic definitions. One can also define notation to fix these problems. How would you like to express ennreal? Any unicode stuff we can do.</p>

<p>I'm gonna agree with Kevin here and say that while long, pretty names are quite nice when you're new and trying to understand the material, there's always going to be a learning curve for reading code when it comes to any language. As long as there's some note at the construction saying that ennreal is the extended non-negative reals, abbreviation is more than acceptable. It gets quite tedious trying to use a certain object over and over again when referencing it takes more than 10-15 characters to type.</p>
<p>Mathematica isn't really a good analogue, because it's not a language in which you're typing dozens of lines of code. A lot of mathematica is note-taking and use of wolfram alpha.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mathematica's code is almost purely computational. You don't have to write out the same words hundreds of times. If refl were reflexive_property and simp were simplify_goal, we'd all go crazy</p>

<p>ya, i agree that there should be a package of abbreviation that we need to remember. abbreviation in proofs are certainly needed. i just think that we could pay attention to <strong>have a balance between brevity and readability</strong>, especially in major definition and theoems</p>

<p>That sounds like an unnecessary mess to deal with. If we're going to define a theorem name, we should do it for usability. Why would you make a naming convention that you're never going to use, and instead overwrite it?</p>

<p>There are actual difficulties in using a proof assistant, and getting used to ennreal is <em>not</em> one of them</p>

<p>I agree that it's important for mathematicians to be able to use Lean, especially since I'm one of them. But just like you said in the very beginning, you could already guess what the ennreals are because you were familiar with the construction. Which shows the convention works. And if you aren't familiar with the construction in mathematics, you probably aren't ready to be messing around with it in Lean.</p>

<p>when i become an insider of lean, this view will certainly be changed</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218709">@Adrian Chu</span> What we <em>could</em> is write a lot more docstrings. Those are comments in the code that show up when you hover over a term in VScode. (So hovering your mouse cursor over <code>ennreal</code> would show a box saying: "The type of non-negative reals with positive infinity". Maybe it even already does that.) Reading Lean code outside of a proper IDE is pretty unusable anyways, but inside VScode (or Emacs) this could be fairly usable. However, lots of things don't currently have docstrings.</p>

<p>I would like a glossary or something like that. The idea is to look up a maths thing, and find out what it's called in Lean, and maybe the most basic peculiarities you need to be aware of to use it. So if someone wants to think about linear combinations, then they know they're called finsupp.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="210057">@Fabian Glöckle</span> mentioned a wonderful idea to me over dinner. We now have AI's that generate captions for images using image recognition. Fabian suggested we train an AI to generate high-level explanations of proofs from Lean source code.</p>

<p>I've been working on a linting tool for a couple of weeks. Right now, it tries to sanitize imports but if we can find a criterion for which theorems should have documentation, I could have the tool enforce the rule</p>
