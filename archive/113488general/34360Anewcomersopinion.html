<p>I am still very new to lean but I have been browsing through mathlib these days. I would like to share one obstacle I observed that an ordinary mathematician would face when trying to understanding lean code. That is, <strong>abbreviation of mathematical terms</strong>.  For example, look at this definition of an outer measure:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>structure outer_measure (α : Type*) :=
(measure_of : set α → ennreal)
(empty : measure_of ∅ = 0)
(mono : ∀{s₁ s₂}, s₁ ⊆ s₂ → measure_of s₁ ≤ measure_of s₂)
(Union_nat : ∀(s:ℕ → set α), measure_of (⋃i, s i) ≤ (∑i, measure_of (s i)))
</pre></div>


<p>In this case, since I am familiar with the definition, I can guess that ennreal = extented non-negative reals, mono=monotonicity, Union_nat= countable subadditivity. But others might get it. Moreover, sometimes the abbreviation is long and odd looking and it's hard to guess its meaning. I understand that abbreviation can shorten the code, but I would argue that in the statement of major definitions or theorems, it worthes avoiding abbreviation in order to increase the readability to ordinary mathematicians.</p>

<p>I can't see it in mathlib. But even if so, there are still many examples of abbreviation causing confusion.</p>

<p>The naming follows a somewhat rigid convention in order to make it easier to guess the names of theorems. Mathematicians are not globally consistent in how things get named, so if you try to follow that kind of pattern you end up confusing even yourself after a while</p>

<p>For the particular case of fields of <code>outer_measure</code>, I wouldn't associate much to the particular names. It's just a bunch of axioms</p>

<p>For example in most presentations of, say, vector spaces you find in textbooks it's just a list of equalities. You can give them names, but they aren't that helpful</p>

<p>It's true that it is somewhat of an idiolect that you have to learn, but there is no way around that. Using mathematician naming for the things that mathematicians bothered to name would just make it a more inconsistent language</p>

<p>With a version of the perfectoid project up until a few weeks ago, we had specifically tried to make our definition of a perfectoid space readable by mathematicians. More recently we've been trying to actually get it to compile, and now it is probably less readable (and still doesn't compile), however it is still pretty readable, indeed it's more readable than it was yesterday morning, and one high priority issue after we get it working will be to make it better readable.</p>

<p>Perfectoid ring is not bad really. Note that one difference is that perfectoid_ring is written by mathematicians, and outer_measure was written by computer scientists.</p>

<p>Johan says outer measure isn't really that bad either -- there is obviously an initial learning curve when it comes to the basic definitions. One can also define notation to fix these problems. How would you like to express ennreal? Any unicode stuff we can do.</p>

<p>I'm gonna agree with Kevin here and say that while long, pretty names are quite nice when you're new and trying to understand the material, there's always going to be a learning curve for reading code when it comes to any language. As long as there's some note at the construction saying that ennreal is the extended non-negative reals, abbreviation is more than acceptable. It gets quite tedious trying to use a certain object over and over again when referencing it takes more than 10-15 characters to type.</p>
<p>Mathematica isn't really a good analogue, because it's not a language in which you're typing dozens of lines of code. A lot of mathematica is note-taking and use of wolfram alpha.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mathematica's code is almost purely computational. You don't have to write out the same words hundreds of times. If refl were reflexive_property and simp were simplify_goal, we'd all go crazy</p>

<p>ya, i agree that there should be a package of abbreviation that we need to remember. abbreviation in proofs are certainly needed. i just think that we could pay attention to <strong>have a balance between brevity and readability</strong>, especially in major definition and theoems</p>

<p>That sounds like an unnecessary mess to deal with. If we're going to define a theorem name, we should do it for usability. Why would you make a naming convention that you're never going to use, and instead overwrite it?</p>

<p>There are actual difficulties in using a proof assistant, and getting used to ennreal is <em>not</em> one of them</p>

<p>I agree that it's important for mathematicians to be able to use Lean, especially since I'm one of them. But just like you said in the very beginning, you could already guess what the ennreals are because you were familiar with the construction. Which shows the convention works. And if you aren't familiar with the construction in mathematics, you probably aren't ready to be messing around with it in Lean.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218709">@Adrian Chu</span> What we <em>could</em> is write a lot more docstrings. Those are comments in the code that show up when you hover over a term in VScode. (So hovering your mouse cursor over <code>ennreal</code> would show a box saying: "The type of non-negative reals with positive infinity". Maybe it even already does that.) Reading Lean code outside of a proper IDE is pretty unusable anyways, but inside VScode (or Emacs) this could be fairly usable. However, lots of things don't currently have docstrings.</p>

<p>I would like a glossary or something like that. The idea is to look up a maths thing, and find out what it's called in Lean, and maybe the most basic peculiarities you need to be aware of to use it.

<p>I looked a little at a doxygen/javadocs esque thing, one thing to note is that e.g. docstrings are in the olean files, so available from Mario's <em>olean-rs</em>, When looking at it I was wondering if it wouldn't be possible to do Patrick's <em>format-lean</em> in docstrings, which I view much as like what Greg mentions above, but in source code comments rather than an external file.</p>
<p>The issue there was that docstrings weren't available in the proof contents you cannot have a docstring for a have statement.  E.g. docstrings get associated with a symbol, I didn't see a way to associate them with a file:line location as well.   Anyhow i felt the whole thing would probably be outdated once the lean4 parser in lean came along anyways,  should revisit it I suppose.</p>

<p>I noticed another issue. Every lemma in lean code has a name, like <code> mem_gpowers_iff_mem_range_order_of</code>, <code>sum_card_order_of_eq_card_pow_eq_one</code>. These names only make sense only after looking at the statement of the lemma. An innocent thought: <strong>why don't we just use numberings like lemma_12, together with a longer and more readable comment?</strong> In this way, when we later need to quote this, we can type much less;  and we no longer need to guess what the string of abbreviation means.</p>

<p>Maybe a <strong>better proposal</strong> is like this: we use abbreviations as names of lemma, but we also write a comment, which expands the abbreviation, for every lemma. And wherever this lemma is quoted, we can see that comment for an explanation by hovering on its name.</p>

<p>What you don't see is that what to you looks like a useless lemma name is to me an absolutely crucial method for funding the lemma. Once you can start to begin to guess what technical lemmas are called, you can find them by guessing half the name and then using basic search functionality like ctrl-space. I actually use the fact that these lemmas are named well as part of my workflow and, in contrast to my initial instincts, I now believe that the system scales well. In my formalisation of parts of the stacks project I deviated from the computer scientist's advice in naming things (files in this case -- I used stacks projects tags) and it was a disaster. This is analogous to rejecting the suggestion that chapters of a book should be called chapter 1, chapter 2 etc. We all do it but it turns out to be a terrible idea now better naming conventions are available</p>

<p>If the only purpose of the comment is to expand the abbreviations in it, then that's not a very good comment. It's like the infamous</p>

<p>which says what the code says without adding anything. Comments are to provide information that <em>can't</em> be gleaned from the code itself, like relations to other concepts, alternate names, references to the literature, and architectural comments</p>

<p>When you hover over a lemma name, lean will show the statement of the lemma, which mostly addresses the question of "what does this theorem assert?". If the statement is long or complicated, then an english gloss is helpful for connecting it to standard mathematical terminology. Actually I think english glosses are usually a good idea, since the duplication of the statement in two different languages can help reinforce the concept. But if it can be generated automatically then it's a rubbish comment</p>

<p>The last theorem prover I worked on, Metamath, has a style rule that all theorems must have a comment. It doesn't have to be much, but there has to be something. This is remarkably effective at generating pervasive documentation</p>

<p>Right... It may be very hard to create a mathematical document that is useful as:</p>
<ul>
<li>certificate of correctness of the theory</li>
<li>reference text for those who know the theory</li>
<li>teaching material for those who don't know the theory</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can still strive to get at much of that as possible. Only Lean will not let us compromise on the first item.</p>

<p>As a newcomer myself, I would agree with Adrian Chu's initial opinion. Two more thoughts. First, whenever one has to weigh readers against writers, shouldn't one side with the readers? In the end, isn't the hope that every theorem will be read much more often than written?  That more time will be spent, overall, reading a theorem than writing it? Second, when it comes to the pain of writing long names, don't modern editors take the burden away from the writer by offering a list of possible completions?</p>
