<p>Is there a way to find out which commit yielded the latest nightly build without installing it? I used to go by the list of commits and select the latest green button but I seem to be missing some</p>

<p>huh, why is the windows build missing there? I just built lean HEAD two hours ago</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="andrew@ashworth.us" data-user-id="110025">@Andrew Ashworth</span> The Windows build is completely separate right now. This will change... soon</p>

<p>ah, that's interesting to know</p>

<p>This may be the most surprising thing I learned since I started Lean: there are academic people and software engineers that use Windows! Who could have guessed that?</p>

<p>Windows ... windows ... Isn't that the square thing on the wall when your lab is not in the basement?</p>

<p>No it's the thing that helps you refusing to help secretaries with their computer issues</p>

<p>Haha! Somehow, they always look at me with such anger when I ask them to fire up a bash shell and use apt-get to install a tool <span class="emoji emoji-1f61b" title="stuck out tongue">:stuck_out_tongue:</span></p>
