Is there a way to find out which commit yielded the latest nightly build without installing it? I used to go by the list of commits and select the latest green button but I seem to be missing some

huh, why is the windows build missing there? I just built lean HEAD two hours ago

@**Andrew Ashworth** The Windows build is completely separate right now. This will change... soon

ah, that's interesting to know

This may be the most surprising thing I learned since I started Lean: there are academic people and software engineers that use Windows! Who could have guessed that?

Windows ... windows ... Isn't that the square thing on the wall when your lab is not in the basement?

No it's the thing that helps you refusing to help secretaries with their computer issues

Haha! Somehow, they always look at me with such anger when I ask them to fire up a bash shell and use apt-get to install a tool :stuck_out_tongue:
