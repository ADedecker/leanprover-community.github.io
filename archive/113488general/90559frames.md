<p>Are frames in mathlib? <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/frame" target="_blank" title="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/frame">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/frame</a></p>

<p>I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A frame O is a poset that has<br>
all small coproducts, called joins ⋁<br>
all finite limits, called meets ∧<br>
and which satisfies the infinite distributive law:<br>
x∧(⋁iyi)≤⋁i(x∧yi)<br>
for all x,{yi}i in A<br>
(Note that the converse holds in any case, so we have equality.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like we have all the ingredients.</p>

<p>Note that the notion dual to a <em>frame</em> is called a <em>locale</em> and these are the gadgets that people use to do topology without points. It seems that mathlib is also fond of doing topology without points, so maybe there is a general interest for these things.</p>
