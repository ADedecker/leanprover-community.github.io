<p>When I type <code>lean --make</code> in Ubuntu, in the directory <code>/home/buzzard/Encfs/Computer_languages/Lean/lean-projects/lean-perfectoid-spaces/_target/deps/mathlib</code>, I get a lot of output which scrolls and scrolls because it's a lot more than 80 characters long. If I make my terminal window super-big and the font super-small so that everything fits onto one line then the scrolling doesn't happen, and it's better when the scrolling doesn't happen because then any errors are far more apparent (I would not expect errors in mathlib but say I'm compiling one of my own projects). Is there any way of stopping the scrolling somehow? I notice that in Windows there doesn't seem to be any output <em>at all</em>. If I redirect STDOUT to /dev/null I could reproduce this -- but then do I still see errors reported? Are they piped to STDERR?</p>
<p>Related I guess -- is it safe to stop compilation with Ctrl-C and then type <code>lean --make</code> again?</p>
