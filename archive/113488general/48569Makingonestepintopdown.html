<p>Natural deduction formalism allows to apply inference rules in any direction - both in top-down and bottom-up direction. That is in opposite to the sequent calculus whose inference rules are mean for bottom-up application only. That is why forward and backward inference is possible in natural deduction, i.e. it is possible to gate statements, to choose inference rule, to choose the direction for the inference rule and make one step of inference. Such logic (as opposite to the restricted versions of first order logic like datalog or prolog) have no clear notion of consequence set, but such single step is some kind of computing of consequence set, part of it.</p>
<p>I am now playing with the Microsoft Lean theorem prover which has documentation for the natural deduction. My question is - can I do the mentioned actions in this prover - i.e. specify statement, inference rule and application direction and get the result? Lean is theorem prover and that is why it may compute only large chunks of those single steps, but maybe it is possible to use Lean to compute such single steps as well? And maybe it is possible to use Lean in API manner as API calculator - to submit statements and flag for the inference rule and get back the statements of such single step in other software? Is it possible and how?Making one step (in top-down,</p>
