@**Reid Barton** Do you know if there is a way to import all our gitter channel into here (other than using the REST apis on both sides)?

I don't know off-hand, sorry. I suggest asking on chat.zulip.org on the "production help" stream

I know there is a tool to do an import from Slack, so maybe it is not hard to adapt
