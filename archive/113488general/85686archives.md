<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="rwbarton@gmail.com" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> Do you know if there is a way to import all our gitter channel into here (other than using the REST apis on both sides)?</p>

<p>I don't know off-hand, sorry. I suggest asking on <a href="http://chat.zulip.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> on the "production help" stream</p>

<p>I know there is a tool to do an import from Slack, so maybe it is not hard to adapt</p>
