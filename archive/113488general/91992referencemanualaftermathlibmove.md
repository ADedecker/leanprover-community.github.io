<p>I don't really understand how all this project moving really works (mathlib moved to leanprover-community, and inspired by this Patrick moved the perfectoid project there too). It just occurred to me that perhaps the reference manual needed updating, because in section 1.4.3</p>
<p><a href="https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html#using-the-package-manager" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html#using-the-package-manager">https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html#using-the-package-manager</a></p>
<p>it says</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>leanpkg new my_awesome_pkg
cd my_awesome_pkg
leanpkg add leanprover/mathlib
# shorthand for `leanpkg add https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib`
</pre></div>


<p>I thought "aah, this won't work now" -- but I just tried it, and it still seems to work fine. Will this stay working in the future? The <code>leanpkg.toml</code> generated by this still says <code>mathlib = {git = "https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib", rev = "f529870e34eb5370ae8ac1f49f728547e4f6bbe5"}</code> though. Is this OK?</p>

<p>Currently <code>leanprover/mathlib</code> is a link or forward or whatever to <code>leanprover-community/mathlib</code>. It does seem a good idea to update this documentation.</p>
