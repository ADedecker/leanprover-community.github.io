:tada: Jeremy updated TPIL to Lean 3.4.1! :tada:

This is great news. My summer students will be using Lean 3.4.1 and I'm sure they'll find this resource extremely valuable.

It uses Sebastian update live Lean with current mathlib (see https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/tactics.html#using-the-simplifier)

It also doesn't feature any weird nat type class example

`inhabited` is a great example to start with. It is very much like the basic examples that people might have seen from Haskell. Spring the nat surprise on them later :-)

There is no more nat surprise

It's gone forever

what is the nat surprise?

#### [Chris Hughes (May 02 2018 at 23:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/TPIL%20update/near/126015484):
The example type class was nat, with one as an instance.

Thanks, a good time to re-read the chapter
