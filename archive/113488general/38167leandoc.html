<p>Now that the perfectoid project compiles, we want to start beautifying it. Parts will probably displayed with Patricks lean-formatter. However, we would also like to generate hyperlinked and syntax-highlighted docstringified webpages from the source code. This should be done by a tool called <code>leandoc</code> that doesn't yet seem to exist.<br>
I invite everyone to point to their secret repos where they have started working on this tool.<br>
Alternatively you may also write a braindump of all the bugs and features that you would like to have in future <code>leandoc</code>.<br>
Let's see how fast we can throw something together!</p>

<p>There is no book which defines a perfectoid space. All we have is research articles and random pdfs written by graduate students and post-docs who were typically preparing for a talk they had to give on perfectoid spaces. It would be great to turn the Lean definition into a useful resource. I can write the LaTeX around the definition (as could Johan) but some sort of cool way of jumping around between definitions would be brilliant.</p>
