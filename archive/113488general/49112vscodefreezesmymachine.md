<p>I just pushed an update to the syntax highlighting in the vscode extension (we can now highlight <code>def /- comment -/ foo /- comment -/ := ...</code> correctly).  Last time I did this, it caused all windows machines to freeze.  I would be grateful if any windows user would upgrade to the latest version of the vscode extension and confirm that it doesn't kill their machine.</p>

<p>My windows box seems fine so far with the latest version.</p>

<p>Tried it and it's fine.</p>
