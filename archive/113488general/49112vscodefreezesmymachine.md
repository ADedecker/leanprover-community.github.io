### ["vscode freezes my machine"](49112vscodefreezesmymachine.html)

I just pushed an update to the syntax highlighting in the vscode extension (we can now highlight `def /- comment -/ foo /- comment -/ := ...` correctly).  Last time I did this, it caused all windows machines to freeze.  I would be grateful if any windows user would upgrade to the latest version of the vscode extension and confirm that it doesn't kill their machine.

My windows box seems fine so far with the latest version.

Tried it and it's fine.
