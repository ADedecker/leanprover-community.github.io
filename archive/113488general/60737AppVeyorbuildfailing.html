<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span>, could you have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/910" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/910">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/910</a> for me? The AppVeyor build has failed, and I don't know what to do about this. Having steps to the PR that mysteriously fail is no good. :-( It's hard enough already.</p>

(This seems to be hitting several other PRs as well).</p>
