<p>Hey, I'm curious - are there any physicists here looking at formalising some of the vector algebra for quantum theory? I couldn't find anything related to e.g. Hilbert spaces.</p>

<p>A first year undergraduate student of mine formalised the definition of Hilbert spaces as part of their summer project, but I don't think there's anything in the official maths library.</p>

<p>I don't recall any physicists coming forward openly. But if you are one, you'd better <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/physics.20attack/near/134230265" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/physics.20attack/near/134230265">beware</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/Banach%20spaces.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/Banach%20spaces.lean">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018/blob/master/src/Banach%20spaces.lean</a> and and there are inner product spaces too, but actually I don't see Hilbert space yet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pretty sure I fixed the issue with Hilbert space so hope to PR soon</p>

<p>Although I only have one trivial lemma about Hilbert Spaces specifically</p>

<p>Ok, thanks! I was looking at (maybe) formalising some results that require notions of a Hilbert space.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120943">@Andreas Swerdlow</span> do you mean it might be included in mathlib at some point?</p>

<p>Hopefully, but it probably needs some cleaning up</p>
