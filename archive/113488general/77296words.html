<p>In his talk in the Formal Abstracts session of the meeting at Carnegie Mellon last week, Tom Hales pointed out that for some purposes, it may be better to use the word "or" instead of the symbol <code>∨</code>. The former is not harder to type than the latter, it is familiar, it is easy to read, and everyone knows what it means.</p>
<p>For fun, I took Chris Hughes' proof of quadratic reciprocity in the library and replaced all the logical connectives with the words "not" "and" "or" "implies" "iff" "exists" and "forall". The result is attached.:</p>

<p>The theorem</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma euler_criterion_units {x : units (zmodp p hp)} :
  (∃ y : units (zmodp p hp), y ^ 2 = x) ↔ x ^ (p / 2) = 1
</pre></div>


<p>becomes</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma euler_criterion {a : zmodp p hp} (ha : a ≠ 0) :
  (exists y : zmodp p hp, y ^ 2 = a) iff a ^ (p / 2) = 1
</pre></div>


<p>and the line</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>have he : ∀ {x}, x ∈ Ico 1 (p / 2).succ → x ≠ 0 ∧ x ≤ p / 2
</pre></div>


<p>becomes</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>have he : forall {x}, x ∈ Ico 1 (p / 2).succ implies x ≠ 0 and x ≤ p / 2
</pre></div>


<p>Call me crazy, but I kind of like the text versions.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>In symbol-heavy statements, the words <code>and</code>/<code>not</code>/etc, will stand out more, and make the reading of the theorem much easier. </li>
<li>Similarly, in word-heavy statements, the symbolic forms of the connectives will likely be more readable than having even more text</li>
<li>I think it fits well with Lean supporting many different "styles" for statements &amp; proofs</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256383">@Enrico Borba</span> But maybe in the word-heavy statements some subtle syntax highlighting could make the connectives stand out, even if they are in text form.<br>
Also, in my field of mathematics word-heavy seems to be preferred. I never see the <code>\not</code> symbol. I sometimes see <code>\and</code> and <code>\or</code>, but it's usually words. The quantifier-symbols are used, but I would still say less than their word-variants.</p>

<p>I don't mean the second point as a downside of having "word" form of the connectives. I mean it as a support for both versions to exist. Syntax highlighting will definitely help resolving any ambiguity for sure.</p>
