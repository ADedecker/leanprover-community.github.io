Sorry last question.  I have a show _ from _ and i get the error that i am expecting something of type k but i have something of type p ^ q -> k, how can i isolate just the right side of the implication? when i assume p is true and q is true before the show command i still run into issues

you can use `assume hpq : p /\ q,`

that contains a proof of the conjunction, which you can destruct with `hpq.left` and `hpq.right`

I think you might actually need `hk ⟨hp, hq⟩` where `hk` is your proof of `p ^ q -> k` and `hp` is your proof of `p` and `hq` is your proof of `q`
