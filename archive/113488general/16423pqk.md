<p>Sorry last question.  I have a show _ from _ and i get the error that i am expecting something of type k but i have something of type p ^ q -&gt; k, how can i isolate just the right side of the implication? when i assume p is true and q is true before the show command i still run into issues</p>

<p>you can use <code>assume hpq : p /\ q,</code></p>

<p>that contains a proof of the conjunction, which you can destruct with <code>hpq.left</code> and <code>hpq.right</code></p>

<p>I think you might actually need <code>hk ⟨hp, hq⟩</code> where <code>hk</code> is your proof of <code>p ^ q -&gt; k</code> and <code>hp</code> is your proof of <code>p</code> and <code>hq</code> is your proof of <code>q</code></p>
