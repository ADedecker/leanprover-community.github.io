<p>Is it possible to have bots listening to Zulip channels?</p>

<p>Are you thinking of having a Lean server respond to some commands?</p>

<p>I find them amusing. In general, the reactions make the chat a little bit happier!</p>

<p>Me too! And it doesn't take space in the thread for applauding stuff you like</p>

<p>Indeed. It's something like "starring" a message at times and someone just casually perusing the conversation has a greater chance of stumbling upon something useful and / or funny.</p>
