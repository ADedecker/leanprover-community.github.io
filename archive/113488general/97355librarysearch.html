<p>... a present coming soon:</p>
<p>Here's a randomly chosen short mathlib proof:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma div_dvd_of_dvd {a b : ℕ} (h : b ∣ a) : (a / b) ∣ a :=
⟨b, (nat.div_mul_cancel h).symm⟩
</pre></div>


<p>Now, let's try</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma div_dvd_of_dvd {a b : ℕ} (h : b ∣ a) : (a / b) ∣ a :=
by library_search
</pre></div>


<p>wait a few seconds, and observe the trace message <code>div_dvd_of_dvd h</code>, which is interesting I guess, but not that awesome.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma div_dvd_of_dvd {a b : ℕ} (h : b ∣ a) : (a / b) ∣ a :=
by library_search [-div_dvd_of_dvd]
</pre></div>


<p>gives <code>dvd.intro b (nat.div_mul_cancel h)</code>.</p>
<p>There were no hints here, just scraping all the imported declarations, and doing a neither-depth-nor-breadth-first search of the tree of applications of lemmas to the goal.</p>

<p>Now, this is pretty sensitive to how much you have imported! With just <code>data.nat.prime</code> imported, this example takes a second or so, but with everything-and-the-kitchen-sink imported it spirals out to 40s, which is obviously unacceptable. But I've barely started optimising / trimming the search tree, so it's possible this will still improve a lot.</p>

<p>Other examples are much less sensitive to the amount imported.  For example I can find the proof of <code>example {a b c : ℕ} (h₁ : a ∣ c) (h₂ : a ∣ b + c) : a ∣ b</code> in about 1s with small imports, and 2s with lots of imports.</p>

<p>(That proof is <code>(nat.dvd_add_iff_left h₁).mpr h₂</code>)</p>

<p>It's very promising!</p>

<p>It's very exciting to see you are back to tactic writing!</p>

<p>Attempting to prepare examples for my students was getting discouraging. Also they are already upset about not being able to find lemmas. :-)</p>

<p>Also -- thanks to Simon and Keeley for help at key points, and Johan's constant encouragement. :-)</p>

<p>But there's still some work to get this polished, it's a mess at the moment!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> I'm glad you interpret my nagging and whining as encouragement (-;<br>
I'm very excited to see this! I really hope we will have a <code>back</code> in mathlib soon.</p>

<p>This is also how I collaborate with Simon</p>

<p>I had some people in my office today who attended Kevin's talk. They had never used Lean before, but they wanted to try it. I helped them setup the system, and they dove in. First thing they wanted to try: prove that the derivative of <code>exp</code> is <code>exp</code>. After we had the statement formalised, I told them about some basic tactics, and <code>library_search</code>. They loved it. It worked surprisingly often, which kept them addicted. Of course, when we got to the meat of the theorem, we gut stuck. But nevertheless: chapeau <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span>!<br>
(I think Kevin would say that they went in instant Isabelle-mode.)</p>
