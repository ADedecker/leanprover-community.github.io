<p>Hopcroft is speaking!</p>

<p>Can you see the livestream still? Atiyah is meant to be on, but the livestream doesn't work for me.</p>

<p>(I get redirected to a login page.)</p>

<p>I got on 45 minutes earlier so I can see the original livestream</p>

<p>the link is a livestream of quite poor quality, but that's Heidelberg Laureate Forum's fault</p>

<p>anyway they'll upload to youtube later</p>

<p>15 minutes in, still introducing the theorem</p>

<p>(no, I don't know how to livestream my computer's audio)</p>

<p>I think you will learn more from watching Mario's live stream than Prof Sir Mike's.</p>

<p>The whole Atiyah story is rather sad and it's a shame that it's come to this. The community knows that he is an elderly man who has become a little deluded. He has spent his entire mathematical life thinking in an extremely flexible way and showing mathematicians the path through treacherous terrains with insightful ideas.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 24 2018 at 10:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512080):
<p>But now he is under the unfortunate impression that general ideas about how to proceed actually equal proofs. He has been like this for a few years, this is well-known amongst the geometry community (at least in the UK). Quite how it has come to this I don't know and really it's rather sad.</p>

<p>he mentioned in the abstract of the talk that his result is based on von Neumann and Hirzebruch and Dirac</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Sep 24 2018 at 10:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Hopcroft%20is%20speaking%21/near/134512139):
<p>now he used the first two guys' result that generalizes Euler's formula to quaternions</p>

<p>Indeed it's a shame that the HLF organisers let this happen.</p>

<p>well someone else would let this happen</p>

<p>he is Michael Atiyah</p>

<p>It's a huge shame that HLF organizers arranged that. I guess they would use any big name</p>
