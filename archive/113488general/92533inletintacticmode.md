<p>Replacing the $ with brackets (or in this case not even brackets) fixes it. It seems to me that the $ wants to eat the comma and things after it.</p>

<p>Is that expected behaviour?</p>

<p>It's not that <code>$</code> eats too much input, but that it has a lower precedence than is used to parse the argument to <code>let</code>. <code>$</code> has the same precedence as <code>;</code>, and <code>let a := b; c</code> is supposed to be parsed as <code>(let a := b); c</code>. Perhaps it should have a higher precedence than <code>;</code>, but it's never quite clear what would be the best order in all contexts</p>

<p>I.e. <code>let d := (nat.succ $ nat.zero)</code> should work</p>
