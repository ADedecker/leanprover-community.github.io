Replacing the $ with brackets (or in this case not even brackets) fixes it. It seems to me that the $ wants to eat the comma and things after it.

Is that expected behaviour?

It's not that `$` eats too much input, but that it has a lower precedence than is used to parse the argument to `let`. `$` has the same precedence as `;`, and `let a := b; c` is supposed to be parsed as `(let a := b); c`. Perhaps it should have a higher precedence than `;`, but it's never quite clear what would be the best order in all contexts

I.e. `let d := (nat.succ $ nat.zero)` should work
