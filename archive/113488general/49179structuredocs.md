<p>I have a new small documentation project, still because the only way I can sometimes learn stuff is to teach. It's a collection of extra explanations, tips, and tricks about structures and classes. The beginning is at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/96" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/96">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/96</a></p>
