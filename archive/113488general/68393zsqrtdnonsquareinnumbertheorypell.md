This should be a `Prop` @**Mario Carneiro**

Submit a PR

@**Mario Carneiro** will you fix it yourself, or should I submit a PR?

(I might also prove that it is decidable)

#### [ Kenny Lau (May 27 2018 at 16:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/zsqrtd.nonsquare%20in%20number_theory/pell/near/127166130):
it's also a proposition
