<p>I'm wondering what everyone thinks about moving mathlib to 3.5? It seems we've accumulated a fair few small fixes there by now, and it would be nice to have them. (As an example, earlier today someone wanted <code>symmetry at h</code> but had to learn about <code>symmetry' at h</code>.)</p>

<p>There's of course some hassle to move the community to a new default version. But I don't see any reason at this point that we should be fearful of switching to a "community" version; that is, it should be no more intimidating that switching from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that when it becomes time to start thinking about migration plans to Lean 4, it's also going to be useful to have some flexibility on the Lean 3 side.</p>

<p>We talked about this a bit in portland. One thing we have to get right is the lean update pipeline; everyone has forgotten how to do that and unless it's really painless no one will be incentivized to do it and bad things will happen</p>

<p>Are there any backwards incompatible changes that need to be made to mathlib in this instance, I seem to remember mathlib compiling fine with community? The only issue I had was that as olean files are linked to the lean version update-mathlib became useless. It would be good as a first step to compile oleans for community too and make update-mathlib use the ones depending on the lean version.</p>

<p>In the upgrade to 3.5, there should be no backward incompatibilities</p>

<p>but I want to restart an update schedule if we start moving ahead with 3.5, and we can't be backward compatible forever (indeed, a lot of the things we want to change are blocked precisely because of backward compatibility)</p>
