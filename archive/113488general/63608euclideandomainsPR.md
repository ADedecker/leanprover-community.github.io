<p>I think <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/78" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/78">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/78</a> is at this point waiting either to be merged or for further comments.</p>

<p>I hope eventually it can be merged, so I can tick off the last box for Louis' summer project.</p>

<p>I merged Louis' PR. There are some minor things that I notice, but it's best to just let that stuff evolve inside mathlib, it's gone through the ringer already and it came out nicely</p>
