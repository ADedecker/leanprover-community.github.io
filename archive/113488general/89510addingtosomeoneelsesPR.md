I have proved that the structure sheaf on an affine scheme is a sheaf of sets. I now need to prove it's a sheaf of commutative rings and we will have our first examples of schemes. However I need a little more transport of structure. In particular I need that the direct limit of commutative rings is a commutative ring. I asked Kenny if he'd done this and he said that he did a big direct limit PR recently but he only did rings, not commutative rings.

you can PR my PR

I can probably figure out how to add commutative rings myself, but this PR has not yet been accepted by mathlib and rather than having to wait for Mario twice

it seemed sensible just to add it now

How do I PR a PR?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 16 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126664417):
Oh I see -- I send _you_ the PR?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 16 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126664427):
So I fork your mathlib?

#### [Kenny Lau (May 16 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126664430):
right

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 16 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126664432):
OK thanks

You can directly push to PR branches of repositories you have push access to https://help.github.com/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/

I'm not sure I have push access to either mathlib or Kenny's fork of it

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 17 2018 at 01:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126671490):
I can't fork Kenny's mathlib, github complains that I already have some other fork of mathlib

#### [Kevin Buzzard (May 17 2018 at 01:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding to someone else's PR/near/126671495):
Kenny I've made my edits, I will just email them to you
