<p>I have proved that the structure sheaf on an affine scheme is a sheaf of sets. I now need to prove it's a sheaf of commutative rings and we will have our first examples of schemes. However I need a little more transport of structure. In particular I need that the direct limit of commutative rings is a commutative ring. I asked Kenny if he'd done this and he said that he did a big direct limit PR recently but he only did rings, not commutative rings.</p>

<p>you can PR my PR</p>

<p>I can probably figure out how to add commutative rings myself, but this PR has not yet been accepted by mathlib and rather than having to wait for Mario twice</p>

<p>it seemed sensible just to add it now</p>

<p>How do I PR a PR?</p>

<p>Oh I see -- I send _you_ the PR?</p>

<p>So I fork your mathlib?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (May 16 2018 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/adding%20to%20someone%20else%27s%20PR/near/126664430):

<p>OK thanks</p>

<p>I'm not sure I have push access to either mathlib or Kenny's fork of it</p>

<p>I can't fork Kenny's mathlib, github complains that I already have some other fork of mathlib</p>
