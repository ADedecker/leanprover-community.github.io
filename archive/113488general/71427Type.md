When I write 

variable α : Type
variable x:α 
def f: α → α → Prop:= λ x y, x=y

#check f (x:α )

I get messages: type mismatch at application f x term x has type α :Type but is expected to have Type Type: Type 1
What mean is it? please can you explain it.

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 02 2018 at 20:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128980473):
Add `set_option pp.universes true` before your `#check` statement, that should be informative. Also, please encode your code snippets between ticks (`` ` ``) so that the font helps seeing what is code and what isn't

#### [ Reid Barton (Jul 02 2018 at 20:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128980495):
`f` has two arguments, `alpha` and `x`. You gave `x` but not `alpha`

#### [ Reid Barton (Jul 02 2018 at 20:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128980519):
So it thinks that `(x : alpha)` is the first argument to `f`, which is the `Type`

#### [ Kenny Lau (Jul 02 2018 at 20:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128980570):
oh lol alpha is explicit

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 02 2018 at 20:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128980581):
Good catch

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 02 2018 at 20:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981193):
```lean
variable α : Type
variable x:α
def f: α → α → Prop:= λ x y, x=y

#check f -- Π (α : Type), α → α → Prop

variable {β : Type}
variable y : β
def g : β → β → Prop := λ x y, x = y 

#check g -- ?M_1 → ?M_1 → Prop

#check g (y : β) -- β → Prop

```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 02 2018 at 20:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981198):
I add ( set_option pp.universes true) but it not run. I do not understand why we need it. In fact, I need ( f(x: alpha) to definition next object. example

( def g (e: α × α):  ℕ := if f e.1 e.2 then 2 else 0 )

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 02 2018 at 20:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981203):
If you use `{` `}` then beta is implicit

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 02 2018 at 20:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981218):
You used nothing, which is the same as `(` `)`, for alpha, so it's explicit

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 02 2018 at 20:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981223):
so then you have to give it.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 02 2018 at 20:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981271):
`#check f α x -- α → Prop `

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 02 2018 at 20:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981276):
And my suspicion that universes  were the root of the trouble did not pan out so you can discard my advice

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 02 2018 at 20:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/128981563):
Thank you I fix it.

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 13:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129017496):
I have the following code 
```
variables {α : Type} 

definition  f : α → list α→ ℕ  
| a     []          := 0
| a     (b :: l)  :=   if a = b then  (f a l)+1  else f a l 
```
and I received messages  
```
failed to synthesize type class instance for α : Type, f : α → list α→ ℕ, a b: α, l: list α ⊢ decidable (a=b)
``` 
If I used type ``` char``` then it run. Please can you explain it and how to use type ```α``` in such cases

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129017656):
The `if a = b then t else f` is notation for `ite (a = b) t f`, where:

```lean
def ite (c : Prop) [h : decidable c] {α : Sort u} (t e : α) : α
```

So, Lean is looking for an instance `decidable (a = b)`. You can tell Lean to wait for an instance to appear until you actually use `f` by putting `[decidable_eq α]` before the colon (`:`).

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129017730):
Note how `decidable_eq` reduces:
```lean
#reduce decidable_eq -- λ (α : Sort u_1), Π (a b : α), decidable (a = b)
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 13:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129017953):
Thank you for that, Sean

```
variables {α : Type} [decidable_eq α]

definition  f : α → list α→ ℕ  
| a     []        := 0
| a     (b :: l)  :=   if a = b then  (f a l)+1  else f a l 
```
It is Ok

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129017975):
Yes, that also works.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018051):
If you put `variables [decidable_eq α]` while learning, it's fine. But note that if you write other definitions or theorems using `α` after that, they will all have `[decidable_eq α]` in their type signatures, whether you want it that way or not.

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018069):
How to repair it

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018070):
That's one of those things that can trip you up when you're writing larger collections of Lean code.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018118):
You can use `section` or `namespace` to make the `variables` local to a region.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 13:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018151):
So, if you know you want to write a bunch of things that need `decidable_eq`, you can:

```lean
section
variables {α : Type} [decidable_eq α]
def f ...
theorem p ...
end -- variables {α : Type} [decidable_eq α] not valid after this.
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018476):
Thank you for that. I used it.  I have more question
```
variables {α : Type} 

definition f (l:list α):Prop := head l = last l 
```
and I received messages 
```
type mismatch at application head l = last l term last l has type l  ≠ nil →  α but is expected have type α
```
How use type which have condition as function last?

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018562):
You should first check the types:

```lean
#check @list.head
#check @list.last
```

```lean
list.head : Π {α : Type u_1} [_inst_1 : inhabited α], list α → α
list.last : Π {α : Type u_1} (l : list α), l ≠ list.nil → α
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018577):
Yes I used it

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018636):
```
import data.list
open list
```

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018642):
So, in order to use `last`, you will need to prove `l ≠ list.nil`.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018658):
I'm not sure what you want to do, but you could have that condition as a parameter to `f`.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018745):
```lean
definition head_eq_last (l : list α) (h : l ≠ list.nil) : Prop := head l = last l h
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018829):
In fact I want definition f such that head of l equal tail of l. In general, I want used type have condition

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018899):
should the empty list satisfy the definition?

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018934):
the empty list is not satisfy definition

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129018947):
Then you can write
```
definition head_eq_last (l : list α) : Prop := ∃ (h : l ≠ list.nil), head l = last l h
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129019196):
I try it but I received messages 

```
failed to synthesize type class instance for α: Type, l: list α, h : l ≠ list.nil ⊢inhibited α
```

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129019478):
That's a consequence of the type of `head`. Easy to fix:

```lean
def head_eq_last [inhabited α] (l : list α) : Prop := ∃ (h : l ≠ list.nil), head l = last l h
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 03 2018 at 14:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129019614):
Thank you for that, I understood

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129019630):
Any time you see this message pattern:

```lean
failed to synthesize type class instance for ... ⊢ C
```

Lean is looking for either an existing instance `C` or a parameter such as `[C]`.

#### [ Sean Leather (Jul 03 2018 at 14:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129019643):
So, when you used `char`, it used the existing instance `decidable_eq char`.

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 11:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129126831):
when I restrict type ``` α ``` to type ``` fintype α ```, I have problem. My code is
```
variables {α : Type}

def preimage (f:α → ℕ ) (u:ℕ ):set α  := λ x, f x=u 

def card_image (f:(fintype α) → ℕ) (u:ℕ ):ℕ 
:= fintype.card (preimage g u) 

```
and I received messages 
```
failed to synthesize type class instance for α : Type, f : fintype α → ℕ, u : ℕ ⊢ fintype ↥(preimage f u)
```
I understand that Lean  find ```fintype ↥(preimage f u)```. What mean is ``` ↥```?  can we show that ```  preimage f u ``` have type ``` fintype```? How I fix it

#### [ Chris Hughes (Jul 05 2018 at 11:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129127521):
This code should work. In the function `card_image`, the type of `f` should probably be `α → ℕ`. `fintype α` is more or less just the statement that `α` is finite. I also made `decidable_eq` an argument to the function as this is necessary to compute the `fintype` instance. You could also use the line`local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable` to achieve the same thing without `decidable_eq`.
```lean
import data.fintype

variables {α : Type}

def preimage (f : α → ℕ) (u : ℕ) : set α  := λ x, f x=u

instance [fintype α] [decidable_eq α] (f : α → ℕ) (u : ℕ) : fintype (preimage f u) :=
by unfold preimage; apply_instance

def card_image [fintype α] [decidable_eq α] (f : α → ℕ) (u : ℕ) : ℕ :=
fintype.card (preimage f u)
```

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129127861):
Thank @**Chris Hughes** for that. 👍

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 20:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129156114):
What mean is messages 
```
maximum class-instance resolution depth has been reached (the limit can be increased by setting option 'class.instance_max_depth') (the class-instance resolution trace can be visualized by setting option 'trace.class_instances')
```

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 05 2018 at 20:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129156386):
That means that you need an instance for a certain type class. Lean is trying to find one for you but gives up. It might be because none exists or because the one that would work is, in a sense, unattainable by Lean. Do you know what type class you're trying to find an instance for?

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 20:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129156858):
my type class is ``` fintype ```. I have code 50 line. when I break it to two file then it run. But I run one file. it give messages

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 05 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129157533):
Can you great a `gist` on github and show me where you break it into two files?

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 21:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129158857):
https://gist.github.com/truonghoangle/b9fa69e939bcb6c20fcf96affc0fd965
I break it after end direct_graph

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 05 2018 at 21:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129158935):
Great! When you break it, what import do you give the new file?

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 21:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129159094):
I use only ``` import data.fintype ```

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 05 2018 at 21:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129159141):
try copying all the imports. You probably use instances from the other modules

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 05 2018 at 21:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129159179):
You can remove one at a time until it breaks

#### [ Hoang Le Truong (Jul 05 2018 at 21:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Type/near/129159316):
Ok it is run. Thank you for that
