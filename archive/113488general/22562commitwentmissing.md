#### [Scott Morrison (Mar 01 2018 at 13:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/commit%20went%20missing/near/123135054):
Hi @**Sebastian Ullrich** , I think your commit https://github.com/leanprover/lean/commit/aaea499242763a256706409beb20617a64d597f0 which fixes #1922 somehow went missing. I saw it on a branch called `mastermaster`, and now I can't find it at all. It doesn't seem to have survived in the current master.
