<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="sebasti@nullri.ch" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> , I think your commit <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/commit/aaea499242763a256706409beb20617a64d597f0" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/commit/aaea499242763a256706409beb20617a64d597f0">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/commit/aaea499242763a256706409beb20617a64d597f0</a> which fixes <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1922" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1922">#1922</a> somehow went missing. I saw it on a branch called <code>mastermaster</code>, and now I can't find it at all. It doesn't seem to have survived in the current master.</p>
