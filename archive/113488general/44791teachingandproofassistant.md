Paulin pointed out to me the existence of http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/%7Edavid/ftp/experiment.ps which may be interesting to @**Kevin Buzzard** and other people interested in using proof assistant with young students

Oh! Many thanks for this Patrick!

That was an interesting read. They were asking fewer students to prove harder theorems.
