<p>Paulin pointed out to me the existence of <a href="http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/%7Edavid/ftp/experiment.ps" target="_blank" title="http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/%7Edavid/ftp/experiment.ps">http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/%7Edavid/ftp/experiment.ps</a> which may be interesting to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> and other people interested in using proof assistant with young students</p>

<p>Oh! Many thanks for this Patrick!</p>

<p>That was an interesting read. They were asking fewer students to prove harder theorems.</p>
