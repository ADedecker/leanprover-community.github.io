<p>I am starting to submit more specialized material (Hausdorff distance in #PR696, but I have the Gromov-Hausdorff space waiting). While the Hausdorff distance is still of very broad use, I have the feeling that maybe the Gromov-Hausdorff space is too specialized for mathlib.</p>

<p>In Isabelle, there is the AFP (archive of formal proof), containing formal developments that are too specialized for the main library. The point is that the maintainers of the main library also correct the AFP to make sure everything compiles all the time, avoiding bitrot. But someone who uses only the main library will not need to compile all of the AFP.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about travis, but would it be easy to set up something similar for mathlib, i.e., parallel to <code>src</code> there would be a directory <code>lafp</code> or whatever name you like, that would not be compiled by <code>lean --make</code> by default but that would still be checked by travis?</p>

<p>I have often wondered what will become of the schemes and perfectoid projects. I forgot about schemes for months after I did it and turned my attention to perfectoid spaces, and then when I went back to it it was unsurprisingly very broken, because algebra had changed a lot, and I needed to get Kenny in to fix it. I feel like if I'd been notified the day a commit broke my repo it would have been a much less daunting job to fix it. Of course I can say "oh, it compiles with mathlib version x so use that" but I don't think that's a very good answer for something like perfectoid spaces -- people might want to use them for other things later as our ambitions grow, and incompatible software is probably a nightmare.</p>

<p>The easiest way for the maintainers to ensure that it build with mathlib is to put it in mathlib itself. As for limiting compilation and recompilation, it certainly is an issue but I think right now it's better to address it by other means than cutting up mathlib in a myriad of small pieces.</p>

<p>I think it's important that maintaining compatibility becomes a broadly distributed obligation. We don't want this to start to fall on a "core" group of sacrificial maintainers. (As, perhaps, has happened with Isabelle.)</p>

<p>I think it is important to maintain high standards for PR acceptance to prevent this kind of degradation</p>

<p>what I think is a really bad idea is to have a bunch of "articles" that are owned by their authors and only subject to minor revision</p>

<p>because this ties peoples' hands later when they want to generalize this or that</p>

<p>As a PR author, you should not get too attached to your particular proofs or the way you structure a development - everything may be subject to change in the future at the behest of the maintainers or as a result of future PRs</p>

<p>I guess putting everything all together puts the burden of maintenance on whoever makes a PR that breaks everything.</p>

<p>The only thing I would try to maintain is monotonicity with respect to proven theorems, i.e. if you prove Sylow's theorem then you can be sure that all future versions of mathlib will have Sylow's theorem, although the proof might change completely, the statement might change, the file could move, etc. (Your name will remain attached to any future versions though)</p>
