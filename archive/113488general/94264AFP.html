<p>I am starting to submit more specialized material (Hausdorff distance in #PR696, but I have the Gromov-Hausdorff space waiting). While the Hausdorff distance is still of very broad use, I have the feeling that maybe the Gromov-Hausdorff space is too specialized for mathlib.</p>

<p>In Isabelle, there is the AFP (archive of formal proof), containing formal developments that are too specialized for the main library. The point is that the maintainers of the main library also correct the AFP to make sure everything compiles all the time, avoiding bitrot. But someone who uses only the main library will not need to compile all of the AFP.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about travis, but would it be easy to set up something similar for mathlib, i.e., parallel to <code>src</code> there would be a directory <code>lafp</code> or whatever name you like, that would not be compiled by <code>lean --make</code> by default but that would still be checked by travis?</p>

<p>I have often wondered what will become of the schemes and perfectoid projects. I forgot about schemes for months after I did it and turned my attention to perfectoid spaces, and then when I went back to it it was unsurprisingly very broken, because algebra had changed a lot, and I needed to get Kenny in to fix it. I feel like if I'd been notified the day a commit broke my repo it would have been a much less daunting job to fix it. Of course I can say "oh, it compiles with mathlib version x so use that" but I don't think that's a very good answer for something like perfectoid spaces -- people might want to use them for other things later as our ambitions grow, and incompatible software is probably a nightmare.</p>

<p>The easiest way for the maintainers to ensure that it build with mathlib is to put it in mathlib itself. As for limiting compilation and recompilation, it certainly is an issue but I think right now it's better to address it by other means than cutting up mathlib in a myriad of small pieces.</p>

<p>I think it's important that maintaining compatibility becomes a broadly distributed obligation. We don't want this to start to fall on a "core" group of sacrificial maintainers. (As, perhaps, has happened with Isabelle.)</p>

<p>As a PR author, you should not get too attached to your particular proofs or the way you structure a development - everything may be subject to change in the future at the behest of the maintainers or as a result of future PRs</p>

<p>The only thing I would try to maintain is monotonicity with respect to proven theorems, i.e. if you prove Sylow's theorem then you can be sure that all future versions of mathlib will have Sylow's theorem, although the proof might change completely, the statement might change, the file could move, etc. (Your name will remain attached to any future versions though)</p>

<p>For instance, if someone changes the name of a lemma in mathlib for better coherence, then she should change the name of all applications of this lemma in mathlib, but also in the AFP. That sounds reasonable, since she knows exactly which lemmas can break, and the new names. On the other hand, the author of the AFP entry  is not aware of the name change, he will only see that the old name does not work anymore, but he will have no clue on the new name and it will take much longer for him to find the new name.</p>

<p>To be sure that this is the job of the PR author and not of the maintainer, it is enough that the green light on travis indicates that both mathlib and AFP compile correctly together.</p>

<p>so what if it's specialized? I think that we should focus more on being able to make use of mathlib where only half of it is compiled because you don't care about the rest</p>

<p>That would be cool, I'm perfectly able to use half of a math book and not care about the rest. Lean should be able to do that to.</p>

<p>I mean lean <em>can</em> do this now. It's just a question of what to <code>lean --make</code></p>

<p>I am not sure if <code>lean --make foo.lean</code> will compile all and only the dependencies of foo, but if so then if <code>foo</code> is your project then you can just make sure that all the theories you care about are imported, then compile it</p>

<p>One option is to have a generalization of <code>init.default</code> import lists, where we have a curated collection of big theory imports. So for example "core only", "mathlib tactics", "programming tools", "basic natural numbers", "commutative algebra", "analysis and measure theory", "computability", "everything" etc. You load one of these files and they import a relatively complete list of files useful for the target area. That way if you care about analysis and measure theory you just <code>lean --make</code> this file, import it, and you are all set</p>

<p>One of these lists can be a rough analogue of what Isabelle calls the standard library (as distinct from the AFP). Anything not in that list is "more specialized" and probably isn't useful for people who just say "I want mathlib"</p>
