<p>I am starting to submit more specialized material (Hausdorff distance in #PR696, but I have the Gromov-Hausdorff space waiting). While the Hausdorff distance is still of very broad use, I have the feeling that maybe the Gromov-Hausdorff space is too specialized for mathlib.</p>

<p>In Isabelle, there is the AFP (archive of formal proof), containing formal developments that are too specialized for the main library. The point is that the maintainers of the main library also correct the AFP to make sure everything compiles all the time, avoiding bitrot. But someone who uses only the main library will not need to compile all of the AFP.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about travis, but would it be easy to set up something similar for mathlib, i.e., parallel to <code>src</code> there would be a directory <code>lafp</code> or whatever name you like, that would not be compiled by <code>lean --make</code> by default but that would still be checked by travis?</p>

<p>I have often wondered what will become of the schemes and perfectoid projects. I forgot about schemes for months after I did it and turned my attention to perfectoid spaces, and then when I went back to it it was unsurprisingly very broken, because algebra had changed a lot, and I needed to get Kenny in to fix it. I feel like if I'd been notified the day a commit broke my repo it would have been a much less daunting job to fix it. Of course I can say "oh, it compiles with mathlib version x so use that" but I don't think that's a very good answer for something like perfectoid spaces -- people might want to use them for other things later as our ambitions grow, and incompatible software is probably a nightmare.</p>
