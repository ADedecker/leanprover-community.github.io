<p>In <code>metavar_context.h</code>, the class<code>metavar_decl</code> keeps a <code>local_context</code> field called <code>m_context</code>, which is the local context in which the mvar was created. In the system description it says "since only closed terms can be assigned to metavariables, a metavariable that occurs in a context records the parameters that it depends on". Is this what <code>m_context</code> is doing? Does closed here mean no unbound de-bruijn variables? The system description seems to imply that the context is stored as a telescope of <code>pi</code>s on the type of the mvar rather than in a special field in the declaration which is confusing me. Thanks</p>

<p>The system description describes an old version of Lean where metavariables are handled differently.  The metavariables in Lean 3 can have free variables in the form of local constants.</p>

<p>This is also the reason for the delayed_abstraction macro, if you've seen it before.  If you want to build <code>Î» x, ?m_1</code> where <code>?m_1</code> could contain <code>x</code> as a free variable, then we insert a delayed_abstraction macro that tells Lean to replace the local constant by a de Bruijn variable when instantiating the metavariable.</p>

<p>Re: publications.  Many of the publications on the website describe old versions of Lean.  I think the ICFP paper from last year (metaprogramming framework for formal verification) and the IJCAR paper from 2016 (congruence closure) are the only two which are up-to-date as of Lean 3.</p>
