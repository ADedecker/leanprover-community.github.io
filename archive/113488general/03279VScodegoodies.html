<p>Would it be possible to configure a hotkey in VScode that grabs the first output from <code>suggest</code> and prepends/replaces the <code>suggest</code> that generated it?</p>

<p>Bonus points if the replace/prepending is automatically chosen depending on whether the suggestion is an <code>exact</code>/<code>refine</code></p>

<p>This should be possible with some ugly tactic state parsing hacks, but I wonder if there might be a better way to do this using a hole command.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> I had also hoped that hole commands would help. But see the other <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hole.20command.20in.20tactic.20mode" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/hole.20command.20in.20tactic.20mode">thread</a> about hole commands in tactic mode. It doesn't really seem to work, as far as I can see.</p>

<p>I think these sort of UI improvements would break down another entry barrier for new users. But I lack the skills of implementing this.</p>

<p>Globally there is a big need for more structured tactic state information. Currently the Lean server returns tactic state as a single string that you see in the Lean message panel in VScode. Even syntax highlighting there is based on a hack. It would be really nice to see this changing in Lean 4, but I don't know what are the plans here.</p>

<p>It would be amazing if hovering and clicking on definitions worked in the tactic state...</p>

<p>Even hovering on <em>notation</em> in the tactic state to see the keyboard shortcut would be useful! But it would be much better for definitions because sometimes they're much harder to cut and paste into something syntactically valid in a .lean file (especially if you're in the middle of something else)</p>

<p>That part is on the editor. Works out of the box in Emacs for example (<code>describe-char</code>).</p>

<p>I think I can see how to implement this for the VS Code extension (but no ETA promise). It will require implementing some custom tooltip functionality for the info view; we can't reuse VS Code's built-in "hover provider". </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> Is it too early to ask how much the Lean server interface will change from Lean 3 to Lean 4?</p>

<p>We'll implement LSP, so... completely</p>

<p>+1 from me. I for one would be happy to see more ideas and discussion of UI here.</p>
