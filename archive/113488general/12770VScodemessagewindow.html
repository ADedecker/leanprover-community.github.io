<p>We now have several tactics that report back with tactic scripts in the Lean messages window: <code>squeeze_simp</code>, <code>tidy?</code>, <code>suggest</code>, <code>extract_goal</code> and in a couple of days <code>hint</code>. Would it be possible to hit <code>C-x</code> <code>M-c</code> <code>M-butterfly</code> and magically have the tactic-script-reporting-tactic under the cursor be replaces with whatever tactic script it reported?<br>
I understand that maybe this would require that the tactic script reports follow a common output format, but that shouldn't be hard.</p>
<p>In principle hole commands would do this. But in practice, that doesn't seem to work. (They work great for dumping a skeleton of a structure, and things like that.) For one, the hole command wouldn't let you inspect the reported script, before hitting the magic keyboard combo.</p>

<p>I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to experiment with the VSCode extension. I already have something now that kind of works:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/pull/143" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/pull/143">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/pull/143</a></p>
<p>For now, it copies the entire message of the tactic (which is what we want for the current implementation of <code>squeeze_simp</code>) and replaces the current selection (i.e., you need to select the characters <code>squeeze_simp</code> in your editor before you press the key combination for this to work properly). So there is a lot of room for improvement :-)</p>

<p>That's already really nice</p>

<p>What would be the best key combination for this? I currently have <code>alt+v</code>. (<code>v</code> like pasting in <code>ctrl+v</code>)</p>

<p>And what should be the format for the tactic output? We could change squeeze_simp to say:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Try this: simp only [foo, bar]
</pre></div>


<p>This is what Isabelle/Sledgehammer says, too. Then the words "Try this:" could be recognized by the extension.</p>
