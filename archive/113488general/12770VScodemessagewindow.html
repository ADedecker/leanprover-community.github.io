<p>We now have several tactics that report back with tactic scripts in the Lean messages window: <code>squeeze_simp</code>, <code>tidy?</code>, <code>suggest</code>, <code>extract_goal</code> and in a couple of days <code>hint</code>. Would it be possible to hit <code>C-x</code> <code>M-c</code> <code>M-butterfly</code> and magically have the tactic-script-reporting-tactic under the cursor be replaces with whatever tactic script it reported?<br>
I understand that maybe this would require that the tactic script reports follow a common output format, but that shouldn't be hard.</p>
<p>In principle hole commands would do this. But in practice, that doesn't seem to work. (They work great for dumping a skeleton of a structure, and things like that.) For one, the hole command wouldn't let you inspect the reported script, before hitting the magic keyboard combo.</p>
