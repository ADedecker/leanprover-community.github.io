<p>Two (classes of) related questions:<br>
1) Is there some reference for the type class inference algorithm that Lean uses? Is it ad hoc, or does it follow some established algorithm? Is it documented in some paper?<br>
2) How will Lean 4 impact the type class system? Is it planned to remain the same, or will it go through a major revision?</p>

<p>I think the canonical answer is that it's a Î»Prolog interpreter, which synthesizes instances by essentially backchaining.  We typically cite [1].</p>
<p>[1] D. Miller and G. Nadathur. Programming with Higher-Order Logic. Cambridge, 2012.</p>
<p>(Not entirely sure if this is helpful.)</p>

<p>Yes, I think it answers 1).</p>

<p>I don't expect any significant changes, but Sebastian can probably speak more authoritatively on this topic.</p>

<p>There are no changes to the type class system planned right now</p>

<p>Maybe I have a newbie question 3): Are coercions and type class inferences somehow two avatars of some underlying common principle?</p>

<p>/me just realises that the Miller--Nadathur reference is a 300 page book...</p>

<p>Once Lean 4 is ready, someone should write "The Leanbook". Alas, I hear that Don Knuth's todo list is non-empty ;-)</p>

<p>I would love to understand the inner workings of Lean. But I'm not a very proficient source reader. In that regard I found the TeXbook very enlightening.</p>
