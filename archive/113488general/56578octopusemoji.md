<p>What do you use <span class="emoji emoji-1f419" title="octopus">:octopus:</span> for? I'm struggling to understand it, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=octopus+emoji" target="_blank" title="https://www.google.com/search?q=octopus+emoji">searching</a> doesn't clarify much.</p>

<p>It's for achievements</p>

<p>you level up</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875353):
<p>well, that's what I use it for.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875354):
<p>So, it's like a “woo hoo!” kind of thing?</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875358):
<p>Arms in the air and all that?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875360):
<p>I think that it was just the community's reaction to the fact that the octopus emoji was constantly listed as "popular"</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875371):
<p>so we had to make it popular</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875375):
<p>Which community, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>?</p>

<p>The Zulip lean-user community</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875418):
<p>Someone just randomly used it for something because it was there</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875419):
<p>and then it just became a bit of a meme</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875421):
<p>as far as I can see, at least</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875490):
<p>I think those emojis under “Popular” were there from the beginning of <a href="" target="_blank" title="">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/</a> and not as a result of being used more.</p>

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875508):
<p>I've also been confused about <span class="emoji emoji-1f6e0" title="hammer and wrench">:hammer_and_wrench:</span>.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 10 2018 at 10:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875766):
<p>Most <span class="emoji emoji-1f419" title="octopus">:octopus:</span> come from Simon who indeed use them as “woo hoo!” . I have no idea what <span class="emoji emoji-1f6e0" title="hammer and wrench">:hammer_and_wrench:</span>  means</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890377):
<p>At last some credit! <span class="emoji emoji-1f61d" title="stuck out tongue closed eyes">:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:</span></p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890392):
<p>I think I'm also guilty of propagating <span class="emoji emoji-1f6e0" title="hammer and wrench">:hammer_and_wrench:</span> it's more of a "cool technical thing there" note</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890412):
<p>Appropriate for instance when one has a quiet "mind blown" moment</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890417):
<p>But I am quite liberal with them</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Apr 11 2018 at 09:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124921055):
<p>There should be a "+1" emoji</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 11 2018 at 09:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124921330):
<p>You would imagine that a +1 emoji would be more useful than the "waxing gibbous moon" emoji they have...</p>
