What do you use :octopus: for? I'm struggling to understand it, and [searching](https://www.google.com/search?q=octopus+emoji) doesn't clarify much.

It's for achievements

you level up

well, that's what I use it for.

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875354):
So, it's like a “woo hoo!” kind of thing?

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875358):
Arms in the air and all that?

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875360):
I think that it was just the community's reaction to the fact that the octopus emoji was constantly listed as "popular"

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875371):
so we had to make it popular

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875375):
Which community, @**Kevin Buzzard**?

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875415):
The Zulip lean-user community

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875416):
Okay.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875418):
Someone just randomly used it for something because it was there

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875419):
and then it just became a bit of a meme

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 10 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875421):
as far as I can see, at least

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875490):
I think those emojis under “Popular” were there from the beginning of https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/ and not as a result of being used more.

#### [ Sean Leather (Apr 10 2018 at 10:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875508):
I've also been confused about :hammer_and_wrench:.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 10 2018 at 10:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124875766):
Most :octopus: come from Simon who indeed use them as “woo hoo!” . I have no idea what :hammer_and_wrench:  means

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890377):
At last some credit! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890392):
I think I'm also guilty of propagating :hammer_and_wrench: it's more of a "cool technical thing there" note

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890412):
Appropriate for instance when one has a quiet "mind blown" moment

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 10 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124890417):
But I am quite liberal with them

#### [ Johan Commelin (Apr 11 2018 at 09:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124921055):
There should be a "+1" emoji

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 11 2018 at 09:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus%20emoji/near/124921330):
You would imagine that a +1 emoji would be more useful than the "waxing gibbous moon" emoji they have...
