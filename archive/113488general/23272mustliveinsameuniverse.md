Any insight into this error?

I think it's because `rbtree` is defined as a subtype, and so contains a field which is a Prop, but I don't know what I should do about it

You can only use inductive types this way. `rbnode` is inductive so you may be able to write your definition as:

```lean
inductive value
| object : forall (t : rbnode /- something in terms of value -/), t.well_formed lt -> value
```

Then you can write a function that puts the `rbmap` back together.

You can define it if you use `meta inductive`

Oh nice, `meta` is good enough for me (for now anyways)
