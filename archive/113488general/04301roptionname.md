<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> What's the meaning behind the name of the type <code>roption</code>? Sorry if I'm missing something obvious :p</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Nov 04 2018 at 11:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/roption%20name/near/137151189):
<p>I literally forget. I changed the name to <code>part</code> in the recent CPP paper, and I need to update mathlib</p>

<p>because I didn't want to explain the crazy name</p>

<p><code>r</code> is for ... raw? right? no idea</p>

#### [ Scott Olson (Nov 04 2018 at 11:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/roption%20name/near/137151301):
<p>haha, fair enough. <code>part</code> does seem clearer. A friend of mine guessed "recursive option"</p>

<p>I seem to recall raw. Maybe in contrast with pfun which has an argument, roption is more minimalist</p>
