@**Mario Carneiro** What's the meaning behind the name of the type `roption`? Sorry if I'm missing something obvious :p

I literally forget. I changed the name to `part` in the recent CPP paper, and I need to update mathlib

because I didn't want to explain the crazy name

`r` is for ... raw? right? no idea

haha, fair enough. `part` does seem clearer. A friend of mine guessed "recursive option"

I seem to recall raw. Maybe in contrast with pfun which has an argument, roption is more minimalist
