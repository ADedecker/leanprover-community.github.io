<p>so, seeing as how there are many mathematicians here, can anyone recommend a textbook on algebraic topology? I'd like to be able to read <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04443.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04443.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04443.pdf</a></p>

<p>Hatcher, of course</p>

<p>thanks, i'll check it out</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110025">@Andrew Ashworth</span> Are you taking on Machine Learning as a hobby? I've been contemplating getting literate in the domain. There seems to be a lot to be done there. I'm curious about proving security / safety properties in those systems but I still don't know where to start</p>

<p>hopefully more than a hobby once i learn more about it</p>

<p>i work in imaging and radar</p>

<p>are you looking for textbook recommendations? that's where i started off</p>

<p>Interesting. ML must be useful but tricky thing to use there</p>

<p>Yes, thanks!</p>

<p>how would you name the groups that can be generated by a set that injects to S?</p>

<p>as in, name them in Lean</p>

<p>What is S?</p>

<p>a random set</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> I just need a short name</p>

<p>you know</p>

<p>So when you say "injects" I assume you have an injective function from S to S?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463276):
<p>Actually, if you show me the construction, that would help me find a name for it</p>

<p>I mean, a group G is inside my structure if it is generated by a set T with an injection from T to S</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 31 2018 at 21:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/random%20math%20question/near/124463328):
<p>Ok, that's clearer. Is that group interesting because of your choice of <code>S</code> and then the group basically says that the set <code>T</code> exists and is the set underlying <code>G</code>?</p>

<p>Thanks! Do you plan on doing some ML in Lean?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p>that would be really hard without a good way of handling algebra and probability</p>

<p>er, by algebra i mean matrices</p>
