<p>Hi, I wonder what should I (as a user) expect from Lean 4 and Lean 3 â†’ 4 porting of mathlib. While I found some slides about new core features coming to Lean 4, I failed to find answers to some basic questions.</p>
<h3>What about compatibility?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do I guess correctly that most of the tactic code in mathlib will have to be rewritten to work with Lean 4?</li>
<li>What about proofs / theorems / defs?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Algebraic classes (monoids, groups, etc)</h3>
<p>Are there any big changes coming here?</p>
<h3>What should I expect from porting?</h3>
<p>Is it going to be "let's feature freeze and port to Lean 4", "let's start a new branch gradually pick files from <code>master</code>", "let's gradually make parts of the library compatible with Lean 4 while maintaining compatibility with Lean 3", or something else?</p>
