What does this bracket do? (a) makes it explicit and {a} makes it implicit, but what does {|a|} do?

If `f : \forall {|x|} (y : A x). B`, then `f` on its own has type `f : \forall {|x|} (y : A x). B` but `f y : B` has `x` implicitly applied. By contrast if `f : \forall {x} (y : A x). B` then `f` on its own has type `A x -> B`, i.e. it is eagerly applied when you mention it
