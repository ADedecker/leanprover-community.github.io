<p>Travis is timing out on completely innocent pull requests, like <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1423" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1423">#1423</a>. <br>
Does anyone know which commit caused this regressed behavior?</p>
<p>I saw that other Github repo's automatically got a reply with compilation performance. Maybe we can make a bot that automatically replies to a PR if the compilation time is increased by more than 5% or something?</p>

<p>I assumed in my previous message that there was a merged commit that caused performance issues, but they all seem fine. Maybe this was a cache-related issue (I merged the PR into master, maybe that fixes it)</p>

<p>Regardless of what caused it here, regression testing for compilation time would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Last three pushes to master built in around 107 (most recent), 100, 110 minutes. I didn't look at the changes, but I assume they were not responsible for this variance.</p>

<p>I'm sure a dedicated machine would be more consistent, I'm not sure how much more consistent.<br>
Doesn't Scott already build everything anyways? Or did I imagine that?</p>

<p>No, at present I'm still building nothing. That project fell through, for lack of anyone who had the time/expertise combination to script things. I <em>think</em> the idea had been to push from travis to my account on S3, and then for my computer to poll that S3 account, but the pushing-to-S3 step never happened.</p>

<p>I think that's <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> 's territory. Checking build times once a day would be a lot simpler. Do you think your server has a consistent enough load to do this with enough precision?</p>

<p>Probably. It has 18 physical cores. I routinely leave some single-threaded calculations running, but it's never more than 6. It's been a while since I've had anything multithreaded that I want left running. So if I limit the build to say 6 or 8 cores, and run it in the middle of my night, it shouldn't have any competition.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span>, I'm helpless at this, it seems. I downloaded zulip's sample python file for posting a message from <a href="api/send-message" target="_blank" title="api/send-message">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/api/send-message</a>, as <code>scripts/zulip.py</code>. I ran <code>pip install zulip</code>, which seemed to work. However running <code>./zulip.py</code> just says:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>idaeus:scripts scott$ python zulip.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;zulip.py&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    import zulip
  File &quot;/Users/scott/projects/lean/mathlib-tools/scripts/zulip.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    client = zulip.Client(config_file=&quot;~/.zuliprc&quot;)
AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;Client&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>which suggests to me that python is not correctly finding the zulip library.</p>

<p>I was thinking it might be nice to run <code>lean --profile</code> with these regular builds of mathlib to get more detailed diagnostics. However, I tried running <code>lean --make --profile src/ &gt; profile.log</code> in my mathlib directory and it keeps segfaulting after a while. Has anyone tried anything like this?</p>

<p>I managed to profile mathlib with <code>lean -j1 --make --profile src/ &gt; profile.log</code>. It took maybe 2 hours on my machine, so it's probably not something we could run more than once a day:</p>

<p>A student has been running calculations in GAP that use lots of RAM, but simultaneously I started experimenting with building Lean regularly via cron, so I don't really know which is at fault.</p>

<p>I've also been having trouble getting my build script to run multithreaded.... Usually Lean uses lots of cores, but somehow when it runs in the cron job, it uses 2 cores for a few minutes, then drops to 1, and I'm completely bamboozled as to why.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>, in terms of giving you (or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span>) access to this computer, I think the options are:</p>
<p>1. We fill out the "campus visitor" form, which would give you an ANU id number. I then get our IT people to add that id number to our VPN configuration. To ssh in, you'd then need to connect to the relevant VPN, then ssh.<br>
2. I make a persistent outbound ssh tunnel to some other server (e.g. the one hosting my website), that forwards traffic back to port 22 here. Dodgy as anything, but that's what they invented ssh tunnelling for, I guess.<br>
It's a bit of a hassle either way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I tried this once, and the conclusion was that sadly if you want to get reliable benchmark results, you need to run your program with pretty much exclusive access to the machine (and on real hardware as opposed to a cloud vCPU). Running one benchmark per physical CPU core skews the timings to the point of uselessness, probably due to contention on memory, on I/O, and whatever else is shared between CPUs. Anyway in case of mathlib, because the build times are so long, maybe random noise is not that much of an issue - unless it's possible for a single run of <code>lean --make</code> to somehow get in a failure mode which makes the entire build proceed slower than usual, but that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>but there is a bit fishy going on; I suspect the times there do not actually reflect the time</p>

<p>How long did everything in the lines in between take? Is the <code>decl post-processing</code> for some reason being deferred, and the report time is wall time, including all the work on other things that happened in between?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> I have looked into this a few weeks ago, and I'm almost certain that "type checking .. took" is incorrect - see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/58" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/58">#58</a>. I'm not sure about the other timings (elaboration, compilation) though.</p>

<p>Here's a python script that does some minimal parsing of these log files into JSON format: <a href="https://gist.github.com/bryangingechen/005e51814e698f889a76b59da0e58852" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/bryangingechen/005e51814e698f889a76b59da0e58852">https://gist.github.com/bryangingechen/005e51814e698f889a76b59da0e58852</a></p>
<p>The JSON files consist of an array of key-value pairs, which mostly correspond to individual lines of the log files (except for elaboration / tactics, which I tried to group together). As a simple example, the following lines:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>parsing took 0.117ms
elaboration of integral took 63.5ms
type checking of integral took 0.289ms
compilation of measure_theory.integral took 0.00211ms
decl post-processing of integral took 0.932ms
</pre></div>

<p>I didn't try too hard to group things together further – if there are other things I should do please let me know.</p>
<p>The JSON files turn out to be ~35MB compared to the ~25MB of the logs.
