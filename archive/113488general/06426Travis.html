<p>Travis is timing out on completely innocent pull requests, like <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1423" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1423">#1423</a>. <br>
Does anyone know which commit caused this regressed behavior?</p>
<p>I saw that other Github repo's automatically got a reply with compilation performance. Maybe we can make a bot that automatically replies to a PR if the compilation time is increased by more than 5% or something?</p>

<p>I assumed in my previous message that there was a merged commit that caused performance issues, but they all seem fine. Maybe this was a cache-related issue (I merged the PR into master, maybe that fixes it)</p>
