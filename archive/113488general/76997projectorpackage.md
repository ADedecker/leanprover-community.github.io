<p>I've just realised that in some of my docs I use the words "project" and "package" interchangeably when talking about "a directory with a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file in it". Are the words interchangeable? If not, which one should I be using?</p>

<p>Yes, they're used interchangeably.</p>

<p>I guess there is a psychological difference, especially you use other people packages in order to work on your own project</p>

<p>Or you could say that your project is to develop the package that you're interested in.</p>
