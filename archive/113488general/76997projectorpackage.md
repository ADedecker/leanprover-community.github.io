I've just realised that in some of my docs I use the words "project" and "package" interchangeably when talking about "a directory with a `leanpkg.toml` file in it". Are the words interchangeable? If not, which one should I be using?

Yes, they're used interchangeably.

I guess there is a psychological difference, especially you use other people packages in order to work on your own project

Or you could say that your project is to develop the package that you're interested in.
