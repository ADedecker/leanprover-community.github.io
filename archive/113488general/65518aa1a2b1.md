### [`[a,a+1,a+2,...,b-1]`?](65518aa1a2b1.html)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Mar 30 2018 at 03:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/`[a,a+1,a+2,...,b-1]`?/near/124393624):
Is there a name in Lean for the list (or multiset, or finset)`[a,a+1,a+2,...,b-1]`?

python `range(a,b)`

```
def range : nat → nat → list nat
| a 0     := []
| 0 1     := [0]
| a 1     := []
| a (b+2) := if b+1 < a then [] else range a (b+1) ++ [nat.succ b]

You will notice that most of the properties of `list.range` are proven by using an auxiliary definition `list.range'`, which is very similar to the list you have described. `list.range' s n` is the list `[s, s+1, ..., s+n-1]`, so your `range` function is `list.range' a (b-a)`. The definition of range' using start and length instead of start and end is of course because it has better properties wrt induction - it's not possible to have a range that goes to a value less than it starts with, and it's best to encode that directly in the definition

def range : nat → nat → list nat
| a 0     := []
| a (b+1) := if b < a then [] else range a b ++ [b]
