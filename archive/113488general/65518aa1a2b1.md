<p>Is there a name in Lean for the list (or multiset, or finset)<code>[a,a+1,a+2,...,b-1]</code>?</p>

<p>python <code>range(a,b)</code></p>

<p>You will notice that most of the properties of <code>list.range</code> are proven by using an auxiliary definition <code>list.range'</code>, which is very similar to the list you have described. <code>list.range' s n</code> is the list <code>[s, s+1, ..., s+n-1]</code>, so your <code>range</code> function is <code>list.range' a (b-a)</code>. The definition of range' using start and length instead of start and end is of course because it has better properties wrt induction - it's not possible to have a range that goes to a value less than it starts with, and it's best to encode that directly in the definition</p>
