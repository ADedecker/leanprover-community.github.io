Using Scott's category theory library, I sometimes encounter subexpressions like `compose f (identity X)`, but with the caveat that one or both of the implicit "object" arguments of `compose` is not syntactically equal to `X`. This appears to stymie `simp` from reducing the subexpression to `f`. Is there a way to make `simp` smarter here?
I know about `erw`, which in my experience solves this problem when I want to use `rw`, but I haven't found a good solution for `simp`.

It's kind of annoying, since I guess `simp` could just generalize the wildcards in the pattern when trying to match the identity lemma...

that is, rather than match against
```lean
@categories.category.compose.{?u_0 ?u_1} ?x_0 ?x_1 ?x_2 ?x_3 ?x_3 ?x_4
  (@categories.category.identity.{?u_0 ?u_1} ?x_0 ?x_1 ?x_3)
```
look for
```lean
@categories.category.compose.{?u_0 ?u_1} ?x_0 ?x_1 ?x_2 ?x_3' ?x_3'' ?x_4   -- make these distinct
  (@categories.category.identity.{?u_0 ?u_1} ?x_0 ?x_1 ?x_3)
```
on the assumption that, if we found this, we can conclude that definitionally `?x_3 = ?x_3' = ?x_3''`, and no need to check syntactic equality

In my experience this doesn't stop simp...
```
def nat2 := nat
example (x : ‚Ñï) : x + @has_zero.zero nat2 nat.has_zero = x :=
by simp

I don't think it tries to match arguments that are dependencies at all

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Jul 13 2018 at 22:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/esimp%3F/near/129627533):
Hmm, strange. I have several uses of `dsimp, simp` where I'm pretty sure the `dsimp` is just simplifying one of these object arguments. Let me look more closely at a simple one...

Here is a small reproducer that depends on `lean-category-theory` (or `-pr`):
```lean

set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true

With the `dsimp [M]`, the only change in the goal is that `(@M C _inst_1 b)` is replaced by `b`

is there any change if you `dsimp` the type of `f` instead of the goal?

Subsequent `simp` is still stuck

`rw` doesn't work, but `erw` does

`erw` will work because it's basically just `dsimp [M], rw`

Maybe your example works because of this `canonize_instances` stuff?

Note that the `simp` tactic actually succeeded, and used `add_zero`. So somehow `simp` didn't care that the `has_zero` dictionary was the wrong one. But looking at `trace.type_context.is_def_eq_detail` output and the `type_context.cpp` code, I don't see how this is possible.

This problem came up for me today, helping someone who had a proof that was approved by the `tactics` but not by the kernel, where there was a `nat.pow` versus `monoid.pow` issue somewhere.
