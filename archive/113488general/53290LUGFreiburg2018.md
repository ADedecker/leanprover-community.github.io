### [LUG Freiburg 2018](53290LUGFreiburg2018.html)

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 11 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133714386):
Hi everyone, I am organising a Lean User Group meeting in Freiburg (Germany). Dates: Monday 5 November – Wednesday 7 November.
I would like to mimic the model of the very succesful meeting in Orsay. So it will be a free-form hackathon with some spontaneous talks. Nevertheless it may be useful to broadly sketch a topic: I would like to use this workshop to work on mathematical topics revolving around geometry, algebra and number theory (e.g., manifolds, schemes, homological algebra, number fields, and any category theory that shows up along the way). Besides that we can also discuss and improve tactics/automation that will streamline our work.
There is limited funding to cover hotel/travel costs.

If you would like to join in this workshop, please reply to this thread while mentioning me (with an `@`).

@**Johan Commelin** I'll come if I can sort it out with my university

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 16:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133736766):
@**Kevin Buzzard** how does this work?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Sep 11 2018 at 16:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133737565):
The best thing to do is to keep it quiet and not announce that you will be taking three days off in the middle of term on a public forum. That way nobody will notice.

#### [Kenny Lau (Sep 11 2018 at 16:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133738187):
I see

Don't book a hotel yourself. Our uni will do that for you.

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 14 2018 at 11:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133941028):

@**Johan Commelin** , anything specific you need from my side?

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 14 2018 at 13:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133947192):
No, I think it's fine now. Our secretary will contact you somewhere next week.

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 10:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134152694):
Our secretary just informed me that she has booked hotel rooms for you. You should get an email with details anytime soon.

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Sep 18 2018 at 10:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134153779):

I got it too, thanks! Would you know at what time the meeting ends on wednesday?

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134154384):
Whenever you want to leave :lol: No fixed closing times.

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 18 2018 at 11:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134154392):
We could discuss what most people are planning to do, in this thread...

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Sep 18 2018 at 11:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134155740):
On Wednesday I will leave around 16h from the station (this is the only direct connection Freiburg -> Amsterdam)

#### [Rob Lewis (Sep 18 2018 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134156130):
Then I assume I'll be on the same train as Johannes.

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 14:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134229539):

@**Patrick Massot**  I asked the secretary to resend the email.

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134230790):
To which email address?

#### [Cyril Cohen (Sep 24 2018 at 17:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134533503):
Hi everyone! On Wednesday I will depart at 15:55 from the airport (this is the only flight back to Nice), I guess I will need to leave Freiburg arount 13:00?
@**Johan Commelin**  Would you know a reliable way to go from BSL EuroAirport to Freibourg kind of late on Sunday evening (the plane lands at 22:10 if it is not late)?

#### [Johan Commelin (Sep 24 2018 at 17:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134533900):
@**Cyril Cohen** I think it should be possible to go from the airport to Basel's train station. And from there I expect regular trains to Freiburg till at least midnight. But I don't have any experience with this...

#### [Cyril Cohen (Sep 24 2018 at 17:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134534829):
@**Johan Commelin** Ok, thanks, I'm looking into it.

#### [Patrick Massot (Sep 24 2018 at 19:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134540456):
:thinking: Johan told me the airport was unusable, so I took train tickets

#### [Cyril Cohen (Sep 25 2018 at 08:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134578422):
@**Patrick Massot** From Nice I do not have much choice: the shortest train ride is still almost 9h long... so I'd rather fly to a unusable airport :joy:

#### [Kenny Lau (Oct 04 2018 at 00:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/135137587):
what are the starting/ending times?

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 04 2018 at 08:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/135155081):
Well, there is no strict schedule. But in Orsay we used to start at around 09.00 AM. (That is Central European Time, for those of us used to Hong Kong time zones). I think you should go for dinner earlier than in Paris. The German restaurants aren't used to people coming for dinner after 20.00. On Wednesday you should just leave whenever your travel schedule requires you to go.

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 23 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136336695):
The first week of November is rapidly approaching. In the initial post in this thread, I outlined what I thought would be nice topics for this meeting.

```
@**Tobias Grosser** has indicated that he would like to work on Presburger arithmetic. Some people in the department have shown some interest, and might want to drop by. So it we might have to showcase the proof of the infinitude of primes a couple of times (-; If there are other things that people would like to coordinate or prepare in advance, I think now would be a good time to discuss it.

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 23 2018 at 15:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136336796):
I can also announce the room where we will be meeting: `SR 232 (II. OG/Stochastik)`. My office is in room 425.

#### [Rob Lewis (Oct 23 2018 at 15:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136338039):
What time are people planning to get in on Sunday? I'll be in Strasbourg that weekend and it looks like there are plenty of connections. Should we plan on dinner Sunday night?

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 23 2018 at 15:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136338183):

Maybe I should also mention which building :lol:
It's the mathematics institute: Ernst–Zermelo Straße 1. [map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=48.00080&mlon=7.84597#map=17/48.00080/7.84597)

This is a 5-minute walk from the main station.

#### [Tobias Grosser (Oct 23 2018 at 19:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136351433):
I will be around 16:00 in Freiburg.

Would be great to meet for dinner.

#### [Tobias Grosser (Oct 23 2018 at 19:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136351474):
Yes, I would very much like to discuss Presburger arithmetic.

#### [Tobias Grosser (Oct 23 2018 at 19:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136351546):
Just to get an idea, who would be interested in discussing decision procedures for Presburger arithmetic?

#### [Tobias Grosser (Oct 23 2018 at 19:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136351589):
In case there is some interest, I could try to prepare a small documents of things I would like to discuss and potentially useful paper references.

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 24 2018 at 06:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136385252):
I am certainly interested in understanding the roadmap. I'm probably not really qualified for in-depth contributions.

#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 31 2018 at 19:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136870815):
Just wanted to let the other participants know that @**Michael Jendrusch** from Heidelberg is also joining!

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 02 2018 at 14:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137025313):
I just checked out the room (232) that we will be in. There are two blackboards, a whiteboard and a projector (beamer). There is a VGA cable, but I didn't see an HDMI cable. There are plenty wall sockets. (If you want to showcase something, and you need HDMI, please take your own cable with you. Otherwise, I can try to find one somewhere.)

#### [Kenny Lau (Nov 03 2018 at 23:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137131488):
Should we meet on Sunday as well?

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Nov 04 2018 at 09:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137148052):
Yes, we can meet! I guess I will be in Freiburg in the early afternoon. Rob should be at the hotel at 7pm.

#### [Patrick Massot (Nov 04 2018 at 12:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137152332):
I'll arrive at 9pm, so I guess we'll meet tomorrow morning. Are we all in the same hotel? I'm at Apart Hotel Mathildenstraße 14. Do we have a starting time tomorrow morning?

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 04 2018 at 12:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137153175):
I live in a little village south of Freiburg, so I won't meet you today. I'll be at the institute tomorrow morning at 8.30. I'm fine with starting at 9.00, like in Orsay.

#### [Tobias Grosser (Nov 04 2018 at 13:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137154067):
I will be there from 5ish. Happy to go for dinner

Johan, I don't mind starting at 9 but your memories are wrong, in Orsay we started at 10 on the first day.

#### [Patrick Massot (Nov 04 2018 at 16:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137159079):
Johannes, I guess I'll see you during breakfast around 8:30 then.

Surely all we can deduce is that _someone's_ memories are wrong...

I am quite sure that my memory is wrong. If I recall correctly, that happens quite often to me.

Hi, I'm also joining the workshop and though I suppose I'm quite late with introductions, I'll introduce myself either way.
I'm Michael, a student from Heidelberg. I am mostly doing machine learning on medical and biological imaging data (I come from a CS / biology background). I've started learning Lean a while ago (and have been lurking on Zulip for some time) for a project where we're formalizing biological protocols on top of microfluidic devices in terms of (symmetric monoidal) categories, so I'm trying to wrap my head around code generation and proof automation for defining types representing symmetric monoidal categories in terms of some generating objects and morphisms.

Anyway, I've arrived at the Hotel in Freiburg and I'm looking forward to the workshop.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 04 2018 at 19:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137165787):
Can you just explain (to a pure mathematician) what biology has to do with symmetric monoidal categories? I last went to a biology class about 30 years ago by the way.

#### [Patrick Massot (Nov 04 2018 at 21:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137170354):
I love hotels having eduroam wifi!

#### [Patrick Massot (Nov 04 2018 at 21:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137170412):
and the German touch: the room has the standard water boiler *and* a beer bottle opener

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Nov 04 2018 at 22:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137171642):
Hm, there is no eduroam in my room :-( I need to write down passwords, like a caveman

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Nov 04 2018 at 22:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/137171654):
So it looks like everybody staying in the hotel will meet at 8:30 for breakfast and then we visit Johann

```
It's not really biology as much as it is microfluidics, where you can have some sample inlets or outlets (objects), together with ways to connect inlets with outlets, such as plain channels, mixers, etc., which do different things to the sample flowing through them (morphisms). Then you can "connect" the outlets of one microfluidic device to the inlets of of another (composition), or put two microfluidic devices next to each other (tensor product). The braiding is exchanging the order of two in- or outlets, which should satisfy the laws for a symmetric monoidal category. As you can flip the directionality of many microfluidic elements in a way that makes sense, you also get a dagger structure for many interesting subsets of what is possible with microfluidics.
Then you have a symmetric monoidal (dagger-) category which gives the syntax of the subset of microfluidics you're interested in and you can give semantics as a functor from that monoidal category to a more meaningful category, say a category of dynamical systems.
Also, there is this whole thing with interpreting biological processes as reaction networks, where you have some proteins and metabolites (objects), with reactions (morphisms) between them, where the outputs of some reactions may be the inputs of another (composition) and multiple reactions may happen in parallel (tensor product), and then you have some functors to give semantics to those reaction networks.

I'm going to sleep now, but I've got something for you guys to puzzle over tomorrow: [leanprover-community/pfilter](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/compare/master...leanprover-community:pfilter) is beginning work on generalizing filters to preorders. @**Johannes Hölzl** if you have any ideas for how all your lifting and monad stuff works when separating the two levels of sets out, I'd like to hear it. I have not figured out what the new version of `join` has to do with the old one (which has a different type - `filter (filter A)` becomes `pfilter (set (pfilter A))` which is not obviously related to `pfilter (pfilter A)`, which is something new).

(why is nobody online?) @**Johannes Hölzl** asked me if a(b+c) = ab+ac for ideals, and I said no at the time, but I have since realized that it is actually true, and I have pushed my proof. In other news, German trains are nice to work in!

Yes, this is true. The thing that's basically never true for ideals is additive cancellation: I+J=I+K is a long way from J=K, e.g. (n)+(m)=(gcd(m,n)) in int, so (2)+(3)=(2)+(5)=(1).

#### [Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 10:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/146929010):

Multiplicative cancellation is sometimes true, but only in the 1-dimensional case, e.g. integers of a number field or Dedekind domains more generally (e.g. PID's) or when the underlying ideal you're trying to cancel is locally free of rank 1 (e.g. principal when R is an integral domain)

@**Cyril Cohen** w.r.t to `param`: The constructor types provided to `add_inductive` refer to the type using already the constant to be defined. So the name map would be just: `bool` -> ``const `bool uparams``

Yep, but it might take a little refactoring, since `parametricity_attr` depends on some of those functions.

**LUG Freiburg 2018 — Report**
We had a Lean User Group in the mathematical institute of Universität Freiburg on November 5–7, 2018.
Participants: Cyril Cohen, Johan Commelin, Johannes Hölzl, Tobias Grosser, Micheal Jendrusch, Kenny Lau, Rob Lewis, Patrick Massot

Johannes gave an update of the development status of Lean 4. Cyril gave a demo of SSreflect.
There were 23 pull requests merged into mathlib (the main mathematical library of Lean) and 6 new pull requests were created. This resulted in 7594 lines added to mathlib and 3163 deletions, changing 100 files.
The topics of these changes include the definition of the perfect closure of a field and the Stone–Cech compactification of a topological space. The Hilbert basis theorem was proved, after a major refactoring of the theory of modules. Others have worked on monoidal categories, sites and sheaves, little-o calculus, transport of structure and improvement of automation tactics. These projects are not finished yet, but should be merged into mathlib in the future.
The participants agreed that the face-to-face collaboration will ease future digital collaboration and that the workshop gave a valuable boost to the development of formalized mathematics in Lean.

(My report was PowerPoint karaoke using Sebastian's slides he presented at the end of his MSR internship )

are the slides about Lean 4 online somewhere?

thank you! :)

Thanks for the report Johan! Of course it must be emphasized that all those merged PR wouldn't haven't mergeable without first having be written before the meeting, and often by people not attending the meeting. And also I think Mario participated in the merge effort from Pittsburg. Nonetheless I agree this was a very successful meeting. Maybe it's worth pointing out to some of your readers that Cyril only installed Lean the day before the workshop, and is now writing both regular Lean and meta-programming. I think it's a huge success that this meeting was able to welcome such an expert Coq user to our Lean community.

I'm not sure who the audience of the report is, but I'd put the sentence about statistics at the end.

I think it's worth mentioning the (existence of) "remote" participants, too.  It's fun to wake up in the morning and see progress on favourite things having happened overnight on the other side of the world. :-)

And I want to beg that future Lean meetings stream more. :-)

@**Chris Hughes** you should have come! :P

@**Johannes Hölzl** du hast noch ein ander PR :D

(@**Mario Carneiro**  this means: you have yet another PR)

he has to translate because he doesn't realize that everyone here uses the same language: lean

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 08 2018 at 05:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/147276514):
Well, he should have translated to Portuguese right?

don't encourage him

Ok, I've updated the report after your suggestions. I will send it to my supervisors.
