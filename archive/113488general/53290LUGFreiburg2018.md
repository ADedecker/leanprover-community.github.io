#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 11 2018 at 09:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/133714386):
<p>Hi everyone, I am organising a Lean User Group meeting in Freiburg (Germany). Dates: Monday 5 November – Wednesday 7 November.<br>
I would like to mimic the model of the very succesful meeting in Orsay. So it will be a free-form hackathon with some spontaneous talks. Nevertheless it may be useful to broadly sketch a topic: I would like to use this workshop to work on mathematical topics revolving around geometry, algebra and number theory (e.g., manifolds, schemes, homological algebra, number fields, and any category theory that shows up along the way). Besides that we can also discuss and improve tactics/automation that will streamline our work.<br>
There is limited funding to cover hotel/travel costs.</p>
<p>If you would like to join in this workshop, please reply to this thread while mentioning me (with an <code>@</code>).</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to keep it quiet and not announce that you will be taking three days off in the middle of term on a public forum. That way nobody will notice.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! On Wednesday I will depart at 15:55 from the airport (this is the only flight back to Nice), I guess I will need to leave Freiburg arount 13:00?<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  Would you know a reliable way to go from BSL EuroAirport to Freibourg kind of late on Sunday evening (the plane lands at 22:10 if it is not late)?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 24 2018 at 17:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134533900):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110193">@Cyril Cohen</span> I think it should be possible to go from the airport to Basel's train station. And from there I expect regular trains to Freiburg till at least midnight. But I don't have any experience with this...</p>

#### [ Cyril Cohen (Sep 24 2018 at 17:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/134534829):

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> From Nice I do not have much choice: the shortest train ride is still almost 9h long... so I'd rather fly to a unusable airport <span class="emoji emoji-1f602" title="joy">:joy:</span></p>

<p>what are the starting/ending times?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 04 2018 at 08:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/135155081):
<p>Well, there is no strict schedule. But in Orsay we used to start at around 09.00 AM. (That is Central European Time, for those of us used to Hong Kong time zones). I think you should go for dinner earlier than in Paris. The German restaurants aren't used to people coming for dinner after 20.00. On Wednesday you should just leave whenever your travel schedule requires you to go.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 23 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136336695):
<p>The first week of November is rapidly approaching. In the initial post in this thread, I outlined what I thought would be nice topics for this meeting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to use this workshop to work on mathematical topics revolving around geometry, algebra and number theory (e.g., manifolds, schemes, homological algebra, number fields, and any category theory that shows up along the way). Besides that we can also discuss and improve tactics/automation that will streamline our work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="122318">@Tobias Grosser</span> has indicated that he would like to work on Presburger arithmetic. Some people in the department have shown some interest, and might want to drop by. So it we might have to showcase the proof of the infinitude of primes a couple of times (-; If there are other things that people would like to coordinate or prepare in advance, I think now would be a good time to discuss it.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 23 2018 at 15:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136336796):
<p>I can also announce the room where we will be meeting: <code>SR 232 (II. OG/Stochastik)</code>. My office is in room 425.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Oct 23 2018 at 15:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/LUG%20Freiburg%202018/near/136338039):
<p>What time are people planning to get in on Sunday? I'll be in Strasbourg that weekend and it looks like there are plenty of connections. Should we plan on dinner Sunday night?</p>

<p>Just to get an idea, who would be interested in discussing decision procedures for Presburger arithmetic?</p>

<p>In case there is some interest, I could try to prepare a small documents of things I would like to discuss and potentially useful paper references.</p>

<p>I just checked out the room (232) that we will be in. There are two blackboards, a whiteboard and a projector (beamer). There is a VGA cable, but I didn't see an HDMI cable. There are plenty wall sockets. (If you want to showcase something, and you need HDMI, please take your own cable with you. Otherwise, I can try to find one somewhere.)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm also joining the workshop and though I suppose I'm quite late with introductions, I'll introduce myself either way.<br>
I'm Michael, a student from Heidelberg. I am mostly doing machine learning on medical and biological imaging data (I come from a CS / biology background). I've started learning Lean a while ago (and have been lurking on Zulip for some time) for a project where we're formalizing biological protocols on top of microfluidic devices in terms of (symmetric monoidal) categories, so I'm trying to wrap my head around code generation and proof automation for defining types representing symmetric monoidal categories in terms of some generating objects and morphisms.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've arrived at the Hotel in Freiburg and I'm looking forward to the workshop.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's not really biology as much as it is microfluidics, where you can have some sample inlets or outlets (objects), together with ways to connect inlets with outlets, such as plain channels, mixers, etc., which do different things to the sample flowing through them (morphisms). Then you can "connect" the outlets of one microfluidic device to the inlets of of another (composition), or put two microfluidic devices next to each other (tensor product). The braiding is exchanging the order of two in- or outlets, which should satisfy the laws for a symmetric monoidal category. As you can flip the directionality of many microfluidic elements in a way that makes sense, you also get a dagger structure for many interesting subsets of what is possible with microfluidics.<br>
Then you have a symmetric monoidal (dagger-) category which gives the syntax of the subset of microfluidics you're interested in and you can give semantics as a functor from that monoidal category to a more meaningful category, say a category of dynamical systems.<br>
Also, there is this whole thing with interpreting biological processes as reaction networks, where you have some proteins and metabolites (objects), with reactions (morphisms) between them, where the outputs of some reactions may be the inputs of another (composition) and multiple reactions may happen in parallel (tensor product), and then you have some functors to give semantics to those reaction networks.</p>

<p>Yes, this is true. The thing that's basically never true for ideals is additive cancellation: I+J=I+K is a long way from J=K, e.g. (n)+(m)=(gcd(m,n)) in int, so (2)+(3)=(2)+(5)=(1).</p>

<p>Multiplicative cancellation is sometimes true, but only in the 1-dimensional case, e.g. integers of a number field or Dedekind domains more generally (e.g. PID's) or when the underlying ideal you're trying to cancel is locally free of rank 1 (e.g. principal when R is an integral domain)</p>

<p><strong>LUG Freiburg 2018 — Report</strong><br>
We had a Lean User Group in the mathematical institute of Universität Freiburg on November 5–7, 2018.<br>
Participants: Cyril Cohen, Johan Commelin, Johannes Hölzl, Tobias Grosser, Micheal Jendrusch, Kenny Lau, Rob Lewis, Patrick Massot</p>
<p>Johannes gave an update of the development status of Lean 4. Cyril gave a demo of SSreflect.<br>
There were 23 pull requests merged into mathlib (the main mathematical library of Lean) and 6 new pull requests were created. This resulted in 7594 lines added to mathlib and 3163 deletions, changing 100 files.<br>
The topics of these changes include the definition of the perfect closure of a field and the Stone–Cech compactification of a topological space. The Hilbert basis theorem was proved, after a major refactoring of the theory of modules. Others have worked on monoidal categories, sites and sheaves, little-o calculus, transport of structure and improvement of automation tactics. These projects are not finished yet, but should be merged into mathlib in the future.<br>
The participants agreed that the face-to-face collaboration will ease future digital collaboration and that the workshop gave a valuable boost to the development of formalized mathematics in Lean.</p>

<p>Thanks for the report Johan! Of course it must be emphasized that all those merged PR wouldn't haven't mergeable without first having be written before the meeting, and often by people not attending the meeting. And also I think Mario participated in the merge effort from Pittsburg. Nonetheless I agree this was a very successful meeting. Maybe it's worth pointing out to some of your readers that Cyril only installed Lean the day before the workshop, and is now writing both regular Lean and meta-programming. I think it's a huge success that this meeting was able to welcome such an expert Coq user to our Lean community.</p>
