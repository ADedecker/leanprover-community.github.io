#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 10 2019 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Learnability%20of%20an%20Oracle/near/154862245):
Say I have an oracle in my vicinity which answers well-formed queries I pose to it in some language $$L$$. For my application, I am assuming it to be a proof-checker kernel. 

1. I am interested in analogues of [Angluin's algorithm](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/james.worrell/DFA-learning.pdf) for *learning* the logic of the proof-checker (or equivalently, the language $$L$$). 
2. Say I generate queries randomly and ask the oracle, what proportion (read *measure*) of  the queries can one expect to be positively answered? 

Apologies if these questions are vague, I've only just read about this a few hours ago and was curious what the community has to say about them.
