Am I a bad person for just writing
```lean
local notation x `∈` y := set.mem x y
```

#### [Gabriel Ebner (May 17 2018 at 15:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697417):
You will probably get into problems with simp, because typically ∈ is `has_mem.mem`, and simp matches the top-most function symbol by name.

Oh, good point... as it happens, I haven't used `simp` in what I'm writing currently

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (May 17 2018 at 15:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697654):
You could of course write
```
local notation x `∈` y := x ∈ (y : set _)
```
... :)

Hmm, I though `out_param` was something like functional dependencies, but Lean didn't infer the type of `i` from the type of `I'` in the expression `⋂ i ∈ I', i.2.2`

#### [Gabriel Ebner (May 17 2018 at 15:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697686):
@**Sebastian Ullrich** This doesn't fix the type of the set, unfortunately.  For example you still can't write `a ∉ ∅`.

#### [Reid Barton (May 17 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697811):
oh, but `⋂ i ∈ I', (i : _).2.2` fixed it!
Do I get a prize?

#### [Gabriel Ebner (May 17 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697812):
```lean
@[reducible] def typeof {α} (a : α) := α
local notation a `∈` b := has_mem.mem a (b : set (typeof a))
example (α) (a : α) : ¬ a ∈ ∅ := by intro h; cases h
```

#### [Reid Barton (May 17 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/∈/near/126697828):
There should be achievements for using things like `i : _`, `by exact ...`, etc.
