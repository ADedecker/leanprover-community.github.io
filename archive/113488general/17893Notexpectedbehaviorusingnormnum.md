Hi everyone,

I have a bare project (with mathlib imported) in which the following code

````
import data.nat.prime  tactic.norm_num

lemma prime_seven : nat.prime (7 : â„•) := by
norm_num
````

displays the error 'norm_num failed to simplify'. Does it work for you?

Best,
Bruno

I get no errors on my system. What version of mathlib are you using? Do other primes like 2, 3 work?

If you click on `norm_num` to go to the definition, search in that file for a function called `eval_prime`

If you don't have it, chances are you are running an old version of mathlib

Oh, is this the 3.4.1 branch issue again?

oh, that might be it

go into `_target/deps/mathlib` and `git checkout master` then `lean --make` (which will take a while)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Bruno Bentzen (Dec 21 2018 at 03:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Not%20expected%20behavior%20using%20norm_num/near/152302974):
yeah, no `eval_prime`. Then I should be really using an old version of it.

Thanks! I'm fixing the build, I think it should work now.

It works now. Thanks, Bryan and Mario!
