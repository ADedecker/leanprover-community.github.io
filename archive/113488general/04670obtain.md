<p>I just realised there is <code>obtain</code>:<br>

<p>I have not yet figured out what it does.</p>

<p>I think I looked it up before and I concluded it was a lean 2 thing?</p>

<p>it is a lean 2 thing. <code>obtain x h, from expr, expr'</code> is the lean 2 way of writing <code>let &lt;x, h&gt; := expr in expr'</code>, at least when <code>expr</code> has exists type. I forget how general it is</p>

<p>the style guide also uses <code>take</code>, which is no longer a keyword and is the same as <code>Î»</code></p>

<p>Ok, thanks for explaining!</p>

<p><code>obtain</code> used to work on all inductive types with a single constructor. It was the way to do <code>cases</code> in term mode.</p>
