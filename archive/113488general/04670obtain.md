I have not yet figured out what it does.

I think I looked it up before and I concluded it was a lean 2 thing?

it is a lean 2 thing. `obtain x h, from expr, expr'` is the lean 2 way of writing `let <x, h> := expr in expr'`, at least when `expr` has exists type. I forget how general it is

the style guide also uses `take`, which is no longer a keyword and is the same as `Î»`

Ok, thanks for explaining!

`obtain` used to work on all inductive types with a single constructor. It was the way to do `cases` in term mode.
