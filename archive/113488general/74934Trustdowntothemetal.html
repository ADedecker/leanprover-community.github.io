<p>While building a trusted computer algebra system, the SANE version of Axiom, I've been looking at questions of trust at all levels.</p>
<p>Andrej Bauer has been working on a smaller kernel (a nucleus) that separates the trust from the logic. The rules of the logic can be specified as  needed but checked by the nucleus code.</p>
<p>I've been studying Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that allow you to create your own hardware in a C-like language (Verilog). It allows you to check the chip you build all the way down to the transistor states. You can create things as complex as a whole CPU or as simple as a trusted nucleus (youtube: Building a CPU on an FPGA). ACL2 has a history of verifying hardware logic.</p>
<p>It appears that, assuming I can understand Bauer's Andromeda system, it would be possible and not all that hard to implemented a trusted kernel on an FPGA the size and form factor of a USB stick.</p>
