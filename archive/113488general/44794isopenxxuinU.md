Given a topological additive monoid, I expected theorems that say that you can translate opens along addition by a given element. But I could not find those... is this in mathlib, or do I need to roll my own?

continuous_add or something

Are you sure Kenny? That seems to prove only that the pre-image of an open under the map lam x, x+c (c constant) is open. But you can't cancel in a monoid and Johan seems to want to show that the image, not the pre-image, of an open is open. @**Johan Commelin** are you sure that what you want to prove is true? What exactly do you want to prove?

and what exactly are you thinking about topological monoids for??

Hmmm, I probably over-generalised.

Let's assume it's a group.

then what Kenny said

Huh, the title looks like a preimage

That's good enough for applications, since I'm a mathematician.

oh yes, Kenny's comment answers the question in the title but not in the body.

Ok, somehow `continuous_add` didn't work straightaway. I'll try harder.

I'm assuming continuous_add is continuity of addition, so now you need to compose with the map from G to G x G sending g to g,c

which is continuous for any topological space

I think this is not true. Consider the topological multiplicative monoid $$\Bbb R$$ and translation by 0

bingo

Hmn, I could PR the `continuity` tactic now that tidy is in mathlib
