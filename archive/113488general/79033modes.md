So what are these "modes"? Johannes talked about `smt` mode and `conv` mode. Do mathematician end users need to know about these modes yet? I have used a `conv` tactic -- is that related to `conv` mode? My understanding of these things is still very hazy. Is there any advice for making it better other than "look through the libraries and try to spot stuff"?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Mar 02 2018 at 17:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123189330):
As you may have noticed, the `conv` tactic isn't really a self-contained tactic; it ends with a tactic block and you have to put other tactics in it. Inside that block, proof states look a little different and there are a different set of available tactics. That is a mode

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Mar 02 2018 at 18:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123192054):
Can I hang out in `conv` mode like I hang out in what I call "tactic mode"? Is that the correct name for that mode? The place where I can access `tactic.interactive` stuff?

Yes, in mode $m you have access to tactics from namespace `$m.interactive`

It doesn't make sense to enter conv mode without using `conv`, but you can e.g. enter smt mode using `begin [smt] ... end`

The idea is that the pipe shows you the current term that you rewrite.

Something like this?
```lean

`in` just navigates to the specified subterm.  Otherwise you start at the top.

You learn about these things in the "modes" topic.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 19:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123194486):
What are the navigating commands inside conv mode? I see you wrote `to_lhs`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 19:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123194781):
That `converter/interactive.lean` could have a bit more docstrings...

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 19:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195234):
There's also congr, which opens subgoals for all* arguments of the current term.
*Well, whatever you can reach via congruence lemmas.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 19:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195289):
I don't understand what that means

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 19:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195392):
What is a "goal for an argument"?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 19:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195447):
Step through this example:
```lean
example : 2 + 1 = 5 := begin
  conv {
    to_lhs,
    congr,
  },
end
```
After to_lhs, you have one goal `| 2+2`.  If you then invoke `congr` you get two goals, `| 2` for the first argument of `+`, and `| 1` for the second argument.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 19:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195620):
Ok, maybe the word "goal" is misleading here

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 20:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195670):
You mean branch the navigation to navigate to all arguments, right?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 20:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195708):
I guess you could say that.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 20:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123195725):
Under the hood each of the branches is represented as a goal in the tactic state (e.g. as 2 = ?m_1), that's where I got the notation from.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 20:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123196026):
After navigating to a subterm, what can you do besides rewrite and whnf?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 20:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123196130):
And if I arrive using congr at two goals but I want to act only on one, how can I leave some subterm unchanged?

It occurs to me that `norm_num` and `ring` should probably be available as `conv` tactics

Maybe "target" is a better term than "goal" in the `conv` monad

This is really mysterious to me. I thought Leo came from the SMT world and wanted to bridge the gap between automated stuff and proofs assistants

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 22:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123201195):
I think Leo has drawn conclusions from his experience with Z3 and SMT in general.  He believes that users are often encoding straightforward problems in very roundabout ways just because they want to fit it into the language of SMT.  This is not the best way to solve these problems.  I remember two stories that he kept telling:

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 22:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123201393):
1) Somebody was using Z3 to solve physics problems.  They took measurements using a camera and (I think) gave equations to Z3 that constrained the position of an object.  However they formulated them as a problem in real arithmetic, which is somewhat expensive to decide.  Inexact numeric methods would have been a better choice here.  (Ok, this story doesn't really say anything against SMT in Lean..)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Mar 02 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123201475):
(and of course the problem with these stories is that failures get blamed on the back-end, not the user's choice of encoding, I guess)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 22:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123201606):
2) The dependently-typed language F* uses Z3 to discharge verification conditions.  They have a wonderful paper on how to write an evaluator using e-matching.  (see http://hatt2016.inria.fr/program/)  Essentially, they output several megabytes of essentially first-order formulas just so that Z3 evaluates an expression like `simp` would.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 22:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123202134):
This one is more my own impression: SMT solvers (and theorem provers in general) have quite a bit of heuristics built-in so that they can handle many problems.  However, just going by heuristics is often brittle.  For example, Z3 has its own tactics language to specify the global proof search strategy.  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36675-8_2  I think Leo wants to do something like this in Lean.  That is, the automated theorem should not do any case-splits, other non-deterministic, or potentially expensive reasoning by default.  Instead the user should explicitly specify the expensive steps using tactics.  This approach could be less brittle and more performant than heuristic strategies.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Gabriel Ebner (Mar 02 2018 at 22:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123202211):
This was also pretty much his answer when I asked him, "why doesn't Lean have the SAT part of SMT?"  He seems to have a bit of bad experience with unreliable proofs in Z3.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Mar 02 2018 at 22:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/modes/near/123202248):
What about all these answers like "smt will do that, so let's not try something else" when Coq people asked for omega or other automatic tactics?

It will do that once it's in a state where users can specify the expensive steps, I guess :)?

I don't know what discussion happened about omega.  I think Leo wants to have omega in the long-term future, but it's not blocking anything right now and it's not scientifically interesting either.  At that point, omega will probably work in SMT mode (if it still exists).  BTW, you can lift any tactic to SMT, so you could use `ring` as omega--.

@**Mario Carneiro** said he wanted to do omega in summer, but I'm not sure what came of that.

When I'll have more time I'll try to write everything I understood about conv (from today's explanations and earlier examples) so that won't be totally lost

I don't really know what omega is meant to do but it seem to help with computation. And computations are really the most inconvenient part of Lean I've seen

It decides linear integer arithmetic (Presburger arithmetic), but only in one of the versions of natural numbers and integers in the Coq standard library.  (They have quite a few versions...)

Ok, it seems less crucial than ring and field (or a version for vector space that would be really awesome)

I think you might be confusing Jeremy and his CMU group with Leo :) That Lean is useful for mathematicians is a happy side-effect of Lean being useful for certifying software.

I believe there is a bad bug in `conv` that makes it fail with "failed to match pattern" if the conv tactic block fails... I never fixed it because I don't really use it

Best stick to prayer. Gabriel and Sebastian are the only ones in a position to fix this if they wish, and they read this chat so consider them informed. Leo isn't going to do anything about "misleading error messages", so reporting it is just counterproductive these days.

I guess I have had the same experience with conv as Patrick -- it has failed for me in exactly the same way (but in contrast to Sebastian I, probably like Patrick, just assumed it was me that was at fault). It's nice to be aware of the bug but now I realise that one can use it in interactive mode I feel like I have a good workaround.

Are error messages something that could be fixed with patches from the community? I mean maybe we could learn to fix it ourselves and just submit those changes.

And my impression is that we're doing that quite well recently. I've certainly sat on a couple of minor things rather than reporting trivial bugs

Of course I also assumed it was my fault, especially since I understood very little of what conv was meant to do. I agree that knowing existence of this bug should be enough to mostly avoid it. But it would still be much nicer if @**Sebastian Ullrich** could fix it.

To be fair, the documentation is the change log was already very efficient. Without the pattern matching bug (now promoted "well known documented bug") it may have been enough to figure it out without Gabriel's help.

Convolution always make great jokes. When I was a third student, my algebra teacher asked the audience "do you know a commutative ring without unit?". After some silence, someone answered: "integrable functions on R with usual addition and the convolution product". The algebra teacher turned slightly green and, after a few seconds, recovered and  told us: "what about even integers?".
