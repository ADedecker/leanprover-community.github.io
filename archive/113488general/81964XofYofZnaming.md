<p>What theorem is called <code>X_of_Y_of_Z</code>? Is it <code>Y -&gt; Z -&gt; X</code> or <code>Z -&gt; Y -&gt; X</code> or even something else? Or are things more fluid than this?</p>

<p>I think <code>X_of_Y_of_Z</code> is <code>Y -&gt; Z -&gt; X</code>: only the consequent is out of order in the name</p>

<p>I disagree with that assessment. I would say that <code>A_of_B_of_C_of_D</code> is <code>B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A</code></p>

<p>As for <code>imp</code>, the difference is that you use <code>imp</code> where you would normally use <code>le</code> or <code>lt</code>: <code>and_imp_and_of_imp_of_imp</code> for example to state that conjunction is monotonic in both arguments</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955306):
<p>frankly speaking, trying to remember how a theorem should be named is kinda of ridiculous. when lean 4 comes out i'm sure <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110027">@Moses Sch√∂nfinkel</span> will write the Lean SearchAbout we've been waiting for :)</p>

<p>looking through that stacks file you wrote I see <code>lemma thingy ...</code> so perhaps you are less fussy than them ;-)</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956317):
<p>The logic I see is: <code>&lt;something&gt;_of_&lt;list_of_assumptions_separated_by_of&gt;</code> and that list of assumptions is in the order that you should feed them to a function application if you build the proof term by hand. You could advocate for <code>&lt;list_of_assumptions_separated_by_of&gt;_of_&lt;something&gt;</code> so that the name mentions assumptions in the same order as the type but I think it's very useful that the first thing you see in the name is what you can achieve with it.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956617):
<p>Yes that's why they went for of rather than imp, right? I like that, I just can't make any sense of the logic for the rest of it when there are two ofs</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956706):
<p>You mean like <code>lt_of_lt_of_le</code>? It proves <code>lt</code> from two assumptions: 1. <code>lt</code>; 2. <code>le</code>. The order of those assumptions is the same as in the name</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956718):

<p>Right. I guess that's where the associativity talk is relevant. It's <code>(lt of lt) of le</code> with the little twist that the assumptions are shuffled ..</p>

<p>Because it's equivalent to <code>lt_of_lt_and_le</code>, the assumptions commute</p>

<p>so you're saying <code>lt_of_lt_of_le</code> and <code>lt_of_le_of_lt</code> should be defeq? ;-)</p>

<p>Of course the names leave out important information that we have to rely on your imagination to fill in. The full name should be <code>x_lt_z_of_x_lt_y_of_y_le_z</code>. Then swapping the assumptions is not semantically meaningful, it's just confusing.</p>

<p>The hypotheses are listed in the order they appear, <em>not</em> reverse order. For example, the theorem <code>A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C</code> would be named <code>C_of_A_of_B</code>.</p>

<p>Don't think too hard about currying these things, theorems are generally fully applied anyway</p>
