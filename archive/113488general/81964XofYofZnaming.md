What theorem is called `X_of_Y_of_Z`? Is it `Y -> Z -> X` or `Z -> Y -> X` or even something else? Or are things more fluid than this?

#### [ Chris Hughes (Apr 12 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954877):
`Y -> Z -> X`

#### [ Chris Hughes (Apr 12 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954879):
as in `lt_of_le_of_lt`

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954882):
Right, that's why I asked.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954886):
I just don't understand how the brackets work

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954890):
If "of" means "follows from"

is `of` right associative

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954929):
since it represents `->`

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954935):
then `Y->Z->X` is `Y->(Z->X)`

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954938):
which is `(X_of_Z)_of_Y`

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954942):
it is also a mystery to me, hah

I think `X_of_Y_of_Z` is `Y -> Z -> X`: only the consequent is out of order in the name

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124954958):
well `(X_of_Y)_of_Z` seems to mean `Z->(Y->X)` and `X_of_(Y_of_Z)` seems to mean `(Z->Y)->X`

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955010):
So are you clear on the logic? What does `A_of_B_of_C_of_D` say?

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 00:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955028):
I don't know these fancy CS terms like consequent by the way

Sorry

I disagree with that assessment. I would say that `A_of_B_of_C_of_D` is `B -> C -> D -> A`

#### [ Chris Hughes (Apr 12 2018 at 00:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955081):
I think `of` doesn't follow right or left associativity rules

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 00:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955083):
Consequent is the only positive term in a chain of implications, i.e. the right-most term.

so a_of_b... is B -> C -> D -> A

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955170):
so how do we put parentheses in our theorem names? who knows

I wonder if we could create a sitcom where a mathematician and a computer scientist share a flat. I'm sure they'd get into lots of crazy (conceptual) hijinks

so `(a->b)->c` is `c_of_a_imp_b`

I don't think that's an associativity rule actually.

if it isn't that way, it should be, it should follow the same rules as `->`

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955238):

As for `imp`, the difference is that you use `imp` where you would normally use `le` or `lt`: `and_imp_and_of_imp_of_imp` for example to state that conjunction is monotonic in both arguments

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 00:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955306):
frankly speaking, trying to remember how a theorem should be named is kinda of ridiculous. when lean 4 comes out i'm sure @**Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel** will write the Lean SearchAbout we've been waiting for :)

i have the same general hatred when it comes to reading C++ qualifiers

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Apr 12 2018 at 01:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124955416):
the rule is, read it from the right and wrap around, which is terrible

Looking through mathlib it does seem to be consistently using `X_of_Y_of_Z : Y -> Z -> X`

Does it really matter? If I want `pos_of_dvd_of_pos` and I get `pos_of_pos_of_dvd` they're both the same thing.

looking through that stacks file you wrote I see `lemma thingy ...` so perhaps you are less fussy than them ;-)

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956317):
The logic I see is: `<something>_of_<list_of_assumptions_separated_by_of>` and that list of assumptions is in the order that you should feed them to a function application if you build the proof term by hand. You could advocate for `<list_of_assumptions_separated_by_of>_of_<something>` so that the name mentions assumptions in the same order as the type but I think it's very useful that the first thing you see in the name is what you can achieve with it.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956617):
Yes that's why they went for of rather than imp, right? I like that, I just can't make any sense of the logic for the rest of it when there are two ofs

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956706):
You mean like `lt_of_lt_of_le`? It proves `lt` from two assumptions: 1. `lt`; 2. `le`. The order of those assumptions is the same as in the name

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956718):
right, as in `lt_of_lt_and_le`

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956722):
Yeah, exactly

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956763):
but not as in `lt_is_implied_by_lt_which_is_implied_by_le`

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956769):

if "of" is supposed to mean "is implied by"

Right. I guess that's where the associativity talk is relevant. It's `(lt of lt) of le` with the little twist that the assumptions are shuffled ..

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956852):

for you `X -> Y ->Z` and `Y -> X -> Z` are exactly the same

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956861):
Yes. As you said

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956866):
Because it's equivalent to `lt_of_lt_and_le`, the assumptions commute

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956921):
They are logically equivalent

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 12 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956924):
so you're saying `lt_of_lt_of_le` and `lt_of_le_of_lt` should be defeq? ;-)

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956928):
Nooooooo, no, no, no! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

then why did you name one after what the other one does? ;-)

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124956942):

Of course the names leave out important information that we have to rely on your imagination to fill in. The full name should be `x_lt_z_of_x_lt_y_of_y_le_z`. Then swapping the assumptions is not semantically meaningful, it's just confusing.

#### [ Simon Hudon (Apr 12 2018 at 01:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/X_of_Y_of_Z%20naming/near/124957015):
Note: defeq and logically equivalent, are not the same by the way ;-)

The `X_of_Y_of_Z` means `Y -> Z -> X` convention is used throughout mathlib, and it was documented a long time ago in Jeremy's style notes

The logic is, the consequent is the most important part, so it comes first (this is important for autocomplete), but otherwise there is no reshuffling of names from the order they appear in the statement or the order you use them
