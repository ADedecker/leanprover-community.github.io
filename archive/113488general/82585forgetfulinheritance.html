<p>Just came across this nice paper from the Mathematical Components crowd: <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336/file/submitted.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336/file/submitted.pdf">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336/file/submitted.pdf</a></p>
<p>The perfectoid people get called out in the conclusion :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As explained in Sect. 3.3, type classes also allow for a variant<br>
of forgetful inheritance, although with a less robust proof search. This was also<br>
observed before, e.g., by Buzzard et al. [11, Sect. 3]. Interestingly, it seems that<br>
the authors have not identified that another issue they raise, about completing<br>
groups and rings [11, Sect. 5.3], pertains to the same problem, and can be solved<br>
using forgetful inheritance as well.</p>
