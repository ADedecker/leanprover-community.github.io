Nice README file in the nursery @**Sean Leather** ! What do you think about having a `test` directory mirroring the structure of the `src` directory so that we can find in `test/foo.lean` examples illustrating the use of `src/foo.lean`? I think we don't have to be strict on the creating of such file, but we should nudge people towards creating them so that you can explore the nursery through its `test` directory.

Yep, that is a good idea.

Alternatively, there could be an `examples` directory for what you describe and a `test` directory that is for tactics and things like in `mathlib`.
