<p>Nice README file in the nursery <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span> ! What do you think about having a <code>test</code> directory mirroring the structure of the <code>src</code> directory so that we can find in <code>test/foo.lean</code> examples illustrating the use of <code>src/foo.lean</code>? I think we don't have to be strict on the creating of such file, but we should nudge people towards creating them so that you can explore the nursery through its <code>test</code> directory.</p>

<p>Yep, that is a good idea.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there could be an <code>examples</code> directory for what you describe and a <code>test</code> directory that is for tactics and things like in <code>mathlib</code>.</p>
