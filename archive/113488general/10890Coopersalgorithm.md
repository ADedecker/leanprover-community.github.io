#### [ Seul Baek (May 20 2018 at 02:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Cooper%27s%20algorithm/near/126812643):
<p>I've implemented Cooper's algorithm for linear integer arithmetic as a Lean tactic (<a href="https://github.com/skbaek/qelim" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/skbaek/qelim">https://github.com/skbaek/qelim</a>). It's still quite limited, but it should work for simple goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cooper</code> is the completely verified tactic that is proof-producing all the way. Unfortunately, it is unusably slow.</li>
<li><code>cooper_vm</code> is the partially verified tactic whose first step (replacing the original goal with the new quantifier-eliminated goal) is proof-producing. The second step (evaluating the new goal to a tautology) is trusted.</li>
<li>The tactics assume sentential goals, so you'll have to generalize variables and hypotheses before calling it.</li>
<li>The implementation is based on Tobias Nipkow's paper (<a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf">http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf</a>).</li>
<li>I've added a few test cases (qelim/lia/cooper/tests.lean) from John Harrison's book.</li>
<li>Right now I'm having trouble making absolute paths work. All references to mathlib are relative.</li>
</ul>

<p>I notice that your <code>atom</code> type uses <code>int</code>. This will kill your efficiency, if you are doing kernel evaluation. You should use <code>znum</code> instead</p>

<p>For others who may not be aware: this is basically the <code>omega</code> tactic everyone's been talking about, although Cooper's is a slightly different algorithm for the same problem</p>

<p>Thanks for releasing this! It looks like it was quite a substantial effort, with the first commit being a few months ago. I definitely want to spend some time looking over it!</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion! Maybe this is what's making <code>cooper</code> so much slower than <code>cooper_vm</code>.</p>

<p>I'm actually having problems with mathlib itselfâ€”when I clone mathlib it won't work as is, because Lean doesn't like its absolute paths for some reason. It works after I manually relativize them.  This is strange because mathlib does have a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file.</p>

<p>actually I can prove stuff about integers (that <code>ring</code> also proves),  so maybe I misunderstood the scope of this tactic. I thought it would work on natural numbers</p>

<p>It doesn't usually matter, Seul is writing a tactic so he needs to have names for his automation. It's fine even if he just declares a local theorem with a particular statement he can rely on.</p>

<p>For example there are lots of theorems in <code>tactic.ring</code> that are like this - they have very particular statements to make it easy for the automation, but no one would ever use those theorems otherwise</p>

<p>But the other day I said "I want to do this rewrite and it's refl but I want to know the name anyway" and your response was "use show"</p>

<p>and I bought this at the time</p>

<p>but this response stinks</p>

<p>But it's also common for definitional expansions to have a name, particularly when the definition is hidden in a typeclass</p>

<p>because I have to keep changing things to definitionally equal things in my head</p>

<p>and I am sitting at a computer</p>

<p>for example <code>finset.subset_iff</code></p>

<p>can I do targetted dsimp?</p>
