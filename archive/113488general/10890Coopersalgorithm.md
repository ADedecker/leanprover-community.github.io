#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Seul Baek (May 20 2018 at 02:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Cooper%27s%20algorithm/near/126812643):
I've implemented Cooper's algorithm for linear integer arithmetic as a Lean tactic (https://github.com/skbaek/qelim). It's still quite limited, but it should work for simple goals.
* `cooper` is the completely verified tactic that is proof-producing all the way. Unfortunately, it is unusably slow.
* `cooper_vm` is the partially verified tactic whose first step (replacing the original goal with the new quantifier-eliminated goal) is proof-producing. The second step (evaluating the new goal to a tautology) is trusted.
* The tactics assume sentential goals, so you'll have to generalize variables and hypotheses before calling it.
* The implementation is based on Tobias Nipkow's paper (http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf).
* I've added a few test cases (qelim/lia/cooper/tests.lean) from John Harrison's book.
* Right now I'm having trouble making absolute paths work. All references to mathlib are relative.

I notice that your `atom` type uses `int`. This will kill your efficiency, if you are doing kernel evaluation. You should use `znum` instead

For others who may not be aware: this is basically the `omega` tactic everyone's been talking about, although Cooper's is a slightly different algorithm for the same problem

Thanks for the suggestion! Maybe this is what's making `cooper` so much slower than `cooper_vm`.

I'm actually having problems with mathlib itselfâ€”when I clone mathlib it won't work as is, because Lean doesn't like its absolute paths for some reason. It works after I manually relativize them.  This is strange because mathlib does have a `leanpkg.toml` file.

What's the algorithm for determining whether an equality whose proofs is rfl gets blessed with a name?

It doesn't usually matter, Seul is writing a tactic so he needs to have names for his automation. It's fine even if he just declares a local theorem with a particular statement he can rely on.

For example there are lots of theorems in `tactic.ring` that are like this - they have very particular statements to make it easy for the automation, but no one would ever use those theorems otherwise

But the other day I said "I want to do this rewrite and it's refl but I want to know the name anyway" and your response was "use show"

and I bought this at the time

but this response stinks

But it's also common for definitional expansions to have a name, particularly when the definition is hidden in a typeclass

because I have to keep changing things to definitionally equal things in my head

and I am sitting at a computer

for example `finset.subset_iff`

can I do targetted dsimp?

This is a new thread. Hang on
