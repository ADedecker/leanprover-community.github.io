Does anyone have a suggestion for Lean-friendly notation corresponding to TeX $$f_*$$ and $$f^*$$?
(Meaning whatever you want them to mean, but for example, post- and pre-composition with the morphism $$f$$.)

Apparently there are no Unicode subscript or superscript asterisk characters

`f^*` works okay for $$f^*$$, but `f_*` isn't as nice because `f_` parses as a single identifier, so it needs a space.

you could cheat and use ï¼¿, which is not _

Or use one of the up/down arrows
