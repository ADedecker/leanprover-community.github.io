<p>My universe issue with perfectoid spaces has become: if I have <code>X : Type u</code> and <code>(Y : Type v) [group Y]</code> and an injection <code>f : X -&gt; Y</code> then I want a <em>group</em> <code>G : Type u</code> and an injection <code>i:X -&gt; G</code> and an injective group homomorphism <code>j:G -&gt; Y</code> with <code>ji=f</code>. Morally I want <code>G</code> to be "the subgroup of <code>Y</code> generated by the image of <code>f</code>, except in universe <code>u</code>". How does one construct that sort of thing? I've never worried about this sort of question before.</p>

<p>I guess that WLOG <code>Y</code> is generated, as a group, by the image of <code>f</code>, and then <code>j</code> would be a bijection -- but I don't know if this helps.</p>

<p>Well, in this case, you can take the free group on X modulo whatever relations are true after applying <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>Oh that'll do for me. Are free groups in Lean?</p>

<p>Actually everything is abelian</p>

<p>but making a free group as a subset of maps from X to the integers, for example -- would that bump up the universe level by 1?</p>

<p>No, only quantifying over types (belong to the same universe as X) would do that.</p>

<p>yes you're right. Thanks Reid -- this is perfect!</p>

<p>Kevin, so you could use <code>finsupp</code> for the free groups. The would be additive, so you need to extract a multiplicative group out of it afterwards...</p>

<p>But that's non-abelian...</p>

<p>indeed</p>
