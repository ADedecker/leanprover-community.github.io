I'm pretty sure I heard at least one monetary bet being discussed at ICMS

For proof assistants, the most favorable winner would be Viazovska.

Other names I've heard mentioned are Geordie Williamson and Ciprian Manolescu.

Oh sure, those are serious contenders. I even understand a bit about what Ciprian is doing. We could at least formalize the statement of his  triangulation stuff.

I would guess Scholze, Birkar, Viazovska, and I have no guess for #4. We will know in a couple of hours!

Schapira will give (or has given?) the laudatio for Kashiwara, this may be fun. It will make up a bit for the fact that Fontaine is not giving the laudatio for Scholze.
