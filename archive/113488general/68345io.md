<p>Is it intentional that the whole <code>io</code> interface (notably including various constants like <code>monad_io_terminal</code>) is not <code>meta</code>?</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 15:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/io/near/134013246):
<p>I just wonder because for soundness, one ought to check that all these constants can be implemented (e.g., by <code>io_core = lam x y, unit</code>) in Lean</p>

<p>Yes, to ensure soundness we would need to show that it fulfills all constraints. But then all these classes are just lists of operations which do not contain any proposition. Showing that they are inhabited is trivial.</p>

<p>But a nice model would be cool, i.e. where <code>io_core</code> encapsulates a state with files, processes etc.</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 16:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/io/near/134013825):
<p>I just wonder whether there's a reason that it is handled differently from <code>tactic</code>, where as far as I can tell all the constants are marked <code>meta</code>. Maybe it's just that <code>tactic</code> has quite a lot more constants, and also the definition of the <code>tactic</code> monad is partially exposed (as <code>state</code> something).</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 16:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/io/near/134013834):
<p>The most interesting thing with <code>io</code> I found is that <code>monad_io_terminal.cmdline_args io_core</code> is a <code>list string</code> which is not meta, so I could do things like make a mathematical definition which depends on the length of this list</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Sep 15 2018 at 16:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/io/near/134013994):
<p>Although <code>#print axioms</code> would reveal what I had done</p>
