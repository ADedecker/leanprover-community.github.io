<p>I don't understand how to make a mathlib PR any more. I used to make a new branch on <code>leanprover-community/mathlib</code> and then open a PR request to <code>leanprover/mathlib</code>. Now I have write access to non-master branches on what is the main mathlib repo. How does it work now?</p>

<p>Nearly the same, just that you open the PR on <code>leanprover-community/mathlib</code> against the <code>master</code> branch</p>

<p>OK thanks; I didn't know you could open a PR for a branch on the same project. I've only done it from a fork before.</p>
