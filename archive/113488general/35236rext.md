#### [Reid Barton (Sep 07 2018 at 12:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133502825):
How about `rext` = `ext` + `rintros`? Is this going too far?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 07 2018 at 12:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133502831):
Or `ext` + `rcases` depending on your point of view

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 07 2018 at 20:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133529587):
That shouldn't be too hard. I thought of doing it before but I had to change the import structure to do it so in the end I didn't bother

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 03:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133590026):
@**Reid Barton**  I just pushed this branch: https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib/builds/426239546 please let me know if it does what you wanted

#### [Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 04:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133590396):
Looks like there are problems in
```
/home/travis/build/leanprover/mathlib/tactic/pi_instances.lean:25:14: error: type mismatch at application
  cons x

but is expected to have type

```

I prefer to think of it as undocumented feature :D

#### [Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 04:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133590508):
:-)

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 05:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133592972):
The documentation of that feature is getting complicated, I'll just remove it

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133605673):
Simon I've just finished building mathlib with your patch; about to try it on my example (although it will require some preparatory work).

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133605680):
:fingers_crossed:

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133605934):
I see `ext` no longer applied `propext` to my goal, is that intentional?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133605952):
I had something like `(\lam a b, f a b) = (\lam a b, g a b)` and I want to intro `a` and `b` and get the goal `f a b \iff g a b` -- where `f a b` and `g a b` are propositions

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606023):
anyways, it worked! I changed
```lean
ext a₁ a₂, rcases a₁ with ⟨⟨i'₁, f₁⟩, j₁⟩, rcases a₂ with ⟨⟨i'₂, f₂⟩, j₂⟩,
```
to
```lean
ext ⟨⟨i'₁, f₁⟩, j₁⟩ ⟨⟨i'₂, f₂⟩, j₂⟩,
```

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 13:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606091):
It is not intentional. Can you find where `propext` is labelled with `extentionality`?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606127):
It... doesn't appear to be so marked anywhere that I can find

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606170):
Is there a way to tell `ext` to trace what it is doing?

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Sep 09 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606267):
`rext` is very nice!

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606277):
Wait, maybe it never used to apply `propext`? I might have been confused because `set.ext` is very similar.

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606386):
I think that's probably it

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606425):
We can add it though

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606431):
Check what happens if you add `attribute [extensionality] propext` before your proof.

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606436):
`only constants and Pi types are supported: Prop`

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606491):
Aha, I understand why the behavior changed.
Before, it applied `funext` once and then, by chance, it happened to apply `set.ext` which is `funext` plus `propext`.
Now, it (correctly) prefers to apply `funext` twice and then it gets stuck.

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606597):
:face_palm: oh dear! I was discussing this with Mario and saying that each type we care about is a named constant ... except for pi types. And now, the type of Prop is also not names so I have to think about making more exceptions

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606754):
`expr.sort`, I guess?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606766):
Also don't forget to implement univalence for equalities between types

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606824):
Now then next exception should be easier to add. Can you send me your example so that I can try it out?

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606844):
I think I included one in the github issue (my real one has some dependencies)

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606848):
But I can also provide it

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606958):
Or a link to the issue please

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606968):
https://gist.github.com/rwbarton/1966db9e4ba470f2a5865f5086776f84, it should compile against your branch

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606974):

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606977):
```lean
import data.set
example {α : Type} (f g : α → α → Prop) : f = g := begin
  ext a b,
  -- ⊢ b ∈ f a ↔ b ∈ g a
end
```

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133606992):
My real example is no more interesting than this as far as the propext issue is concerned--it's just a test case for the `rext` feature.

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607603):
Cool, that works now. I'll push it and then get some sleep :)

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607651):
(Wait aren't we in the same time zone...)

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607659):
Are you on the east coast of the US?

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607661):
But to answer your surprise, when I program, time flies and I forget to do all kinds of stuff

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607702):
... including sleeping

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607754):
Yes. But still have not adjusted from being in Europe and have been up for 4 hours today...

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607767):
Were you in the UK? You seem to be driving on the wrong side of the road ... the road being a stand-in for the night, and the wrong side is being awake after 4 rather than awake until 4 :D

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607807):
Yeah, my metaphors are not that enlightening ...

#### [Reid Barton (Sep 09 2018 at 14:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607808):
So we seem to be off by a full 12 hours from each other, yes

#### [Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 14:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/rext/near/133607854):
For today at least
