#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 08:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133596936):
Does anyone know the behaviour of `meta constant expr.replace : expr → (expr → nat → option expr) → expr`?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 08:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133596945):
(I have an expression that has a single `mvar` somewhere in it; I would like to replace that with an `expr.var 0`.)

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597029):
You could try implementing it as `e.replace $ λ e' _, if e'.is_mvar then expr.var 0 else  none`

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597036):
It might not work if `replace` does not proceed recursively but your attempt should help us decide what to do next.

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 09 2018 at 08:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597037):
you should probably use the `n` variable though

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 09 2018 at 08:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597038):
`e.replace $ λ e' n, if e'.is_mvar then expr.var n else  none`

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597079):
Ooooooh! Is that what it's for? That's so cool!

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 08:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597174):
Neat!

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 08:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597181):
Do you guys have an `expr.is_mvar` that I'm missing?

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 09 2018 at 08:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597243):
no, looks like you will have to roll your own

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597254):
I thought it was in `mathlib`

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597260):
Ah! In `tactic.basic`, there it is called `is_meta_var`

#### [ Scott Morrison (Sep 09 2018 at 08:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597304):
Thanks.

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Sep 09 2018 at 08:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597321):
should we be more regular in the naming there?

#### [ Simon Hudon (Sep 09 2018 at 08:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/133597365):
Probably, yes

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 20 2018 at 21:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136182545):
Is there any documentation anywhere on what all the constructors to `expr` mean?

#### [ Simon Hudon (Oct 20 2018 at 22:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136183618):
Not that I know of. It would be worth writing. What do you want to know?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 20 2018 at 23:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136186327):
I would love to have a paragraph on each. I have to re-remember the order of arguments to expr.pi every time I see it.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 21 2018 at 00:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136187796):
Essentially what Scott's talking about. What each of the arguments to each constructor represents.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 21 2018 at 00:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136187976):
Didn't Ed Ayers write this at some point? He had a draft of some docs on meta stuff, but I think it was never PR'd.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 21 2018 at 06:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136199026):
Are `expr tt`s allowed to contain metavariables?

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204211):
yes

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204262):
as far as I understand, `expr tt` means that the expression has been typechecked and fully elaborated.

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204263):

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204269):
@**Scott Morrison|110087** yeah I should PR it at some point.

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204315):
I build Lean from source with extra docstrings.

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 21 2018 at 10:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136204675):
`binder_info` is only used by the elaborator.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 21 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136219638):
Thanks for this.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 21 2018 at 19:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136221625):
What does `tactic.generalize` do?

#### [ Simon Hudon (Oct 21 2018 at 20:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136224003):
If you have `⊢ x + 1 ≤ y + 2`, ```generalize ``(y + 2) `z``` will turn the goal into `⊢ x + 1 ≤ z`

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 21 2018 at 20:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136224045):
Okay thanks.

#### [ Simon Hudon (Oct 21 2018 at 20:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136224062):
The interactive version offers more options like adding an assumption `h : y + 2 = z`

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136233210):
@**Edward Ayers** An `expr tt` may not actually have been typechecked, but it is presumed to at least have the structure to be typechecked

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 22 2018 at 10:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136254342):
Ok so does `expr tt` just mean that there are no placeholders?

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Oct 22 2018 at 11:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136254555):
Well, technically yes since "placeholder" is the name used for the macro that represents the `_` syntactical form.  But both `expr ff` and `expr tt` can have metavariables.

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Oct 22 2018 at 11:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136254645):
The big difference between `expr ff` and `expr tt` is whether implicit arguments are present.  For example the equality `x = x` is represented in `expr ff` as ``app (app (const `eq _) x) x`` while in `expr tt` it is represented as ``app (app (app (const `eq _) t) x) x`` (one more argument).

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 22 2018 at 11:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136255803):
What is the difference between `implicit` and `strict_implicit`?

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 22 2018 at 11:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136255844):
For `binder_info`

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Oct 22 2018 at 11:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136256137):
`default` = `(x : α)`, `implicit` = `{x : α}`, `strict_implicit` = `⦃x : α⦄`, `inst_implicit` = `[x : α]`, I believe `aux_decl` is used as a tag for the `_match` hypotheses but I could be completely mistaken.

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Oct 22 2018 at 11:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136256251):
The difference between `{}` and `⦃⦄` is how implicit arguments are treated that are *not* followed by explicit arguments.  `{}` arguments are applied eagerly, while `⦃⦄` arguments are left partially applied:
```lean
def foo {x : ℕ} : ℕ := x
def bar ⦃x : ℕ⦄ : ℕ := x
#check foo -- foo : ℕ
#check bar -- bar : Π ⦃x : ℕ⦄, ℕ
```

#### [ Edward Ayers (Oct 22 2018 at 11:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136256815):
In C++ it says that `aux_decl` is "used to mark local constants representing recursive functions
        in recursive equations and `match` statements."

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 11:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136256893):
`aux_decl` is used for `_match`, `_fun_match`, `_let_match` and the self reference that appears in recursive pattern matching

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 22 2018 at 11:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136256937):
these are not real local constants, but rather trigger recursive compilation when used

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 23 2018 at 23:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136369830):
If `pexpr` and `expr` are more or less the exact same inductive type how are they different? Is it just because in practice we never define them from constructors ourselves and always use the inbuilt functions which treat `pexpr` and `expr` differently even though the type doesn't force them to?

#### [ Floris van Doorn (Oct 24 2018 at 04:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136382261):
As Gabriel said above, the same term is represented differently as an `pexpr` than as an `expr`. Moreover, for both structures there are some constants such as `expr.mk_sorry`, `pexpr.mk_placeholder` and `pexpr.mk_explicit` which only exist in one of the two variants, but not the other. These are not represented by the inductive structure. But `mk_placeholder` and `mk_explicit` will be used (for example) by the tactic `to_expr`.

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 28 2018 at 17:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136660474):
Is there an easy way of printing an `expr` in terms of the constructors of `expr`?

#### [ Rob Lewis (Oct 28 2018 at 18:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136661109):
`expr.to_raw_fmt`

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 28 2018 at 18:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/136661131):
Thanks

#### [ Chris Hughes (Nov 04 2018 at 16:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/137160587):
If I'm writing a tactic and I have `e : expr`, which is a proof of equality, how would I do `rw e at *` say, or `simp [e] at *` as part of a tactic?

#### [ Keeley Hoek (Nov 05 2018 at 01:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/137178093):
You can `rw` another arbitrary `expr` using `rewrite_core`. I would have to read the `tactic.interactive.rw` definition to see how it replaces local hypotheses, too, but that's the idea.

For `simp` you need to call `mk_simp_set` and then add your lemma to it. Then you need to pass that data to the built-in function `tactic.simplify`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 03:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/137181620):
often a cheap way to do these sorts of things is using tactic quotations, e.g. `` `[simp at *] ``

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 04:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/expr/near/137181673):
I'm guessing you can use antiquotations, and write something like `` `[simp [%%e] at *]``.
