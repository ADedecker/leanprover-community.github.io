I have `lhs rhs : expr`, and I would like to know, if the goal were to be `lhs = rhs`,  whether or not `refl` would succeed. I could temporarily make the goal actually `lhs = rhs`, and try `refl`, but I'm wondering if it can be done directly.

I'm only hesitant to overwrite the goal because the actual current goal may be something completely unrelated to what my tactic is thinking about that the moment it's wondering about `lhs = rhs`, and it feels kludgy to actually have to use `set_goal`.

The problem is that `refl` is basically just shorthand for ``mk_const `eq.refl >>= Î» r, apply_core r``, and `apply_core` only unifies with the goal.

@**Scott Morrison** Take a look at `tactic.solve_aux`

Thanks @**Sebastian Ullrich**. Implicit in your answer is "get over it, just set_goal to whatever you want, it's how you're meant to do this"! Good to know.

If you want to look at it like that, yes :)

What if you try to unify them directly? `unify lhs rhs`
