<p>I have <code>lhs rhs : expr</code>, and I would like to know, if the goal were to be <code>lhs = rhs</code>,  whether or not <code>refl</code> would succeed. I could temporarily make the goal actually <code>lhs = rhs</code>, and try <code>refl</code>, but I'm wondering if it can be done directly.</p>

<p>I'm only hesitant to overwrite the goal because the actual current goal may be something completely unrelated to what my tactic is thinking about that the moment it's wondering about <code>lhs = rhs</code>, and it feels kludgy to actually have to use <code>set_goal</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>refl</code> is basically just shorthand for <code>mk_const `eq.refl &gt;&gt;= Î» r, apply_core r</code>, and <code>apply_core</code> only unifies with the goal.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>. Implicit in your answer is "get over it, just set_goal to whatever you want, it's how you're meant to do this"! Good to know.</p>

<p>If you want to look at it like that, yes :)</p>

<p>What if you try to unify them directly? <code>unify lhs rhs</code></p>
