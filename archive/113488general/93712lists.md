```lean
theorem append_inj : ∀ {s₁ s₂ t₁ t₂ : list α}, s₁ ++ t₁ = s₂ ++ t₂ → length s₁ = length s₂ → s₁ = s₂ ∧ t₁ = t₂
| []      []      t₁ t₂ h hl := ⟨rfl, h⟩
| (a::s₁) []      t₁ t₂ h hl := list.no_confusion $ eq_nil_of_length_eq_zero hl
| []      (b::s₂) t₁ t₂ h hl := list.no_confusion $ eq_nil_of_length_eq_zero hl.symm
| (a::s₁) (b::s₂) t₁ t₂ h hl := list.no_confusion h $ λab hap,
  let ⟨e1, e2⟩ := @append_inj s₁ s₂ t₁ t₂ hap (succ.inj hl) in
  by rw [ab, e1, e2]; exact ⟨rfl, rfl⟩
``` 
why is `length s1 = length s2` required explicitly as a hypothesis?

It's not true otherwise

ahh. i guess you'd only have a weaker conclusion without the length requirement, that two lists exist that are subsets of `s1 ++ t1`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Feb 28 2018 at 03:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lists/near/123070167):
Of course that's a trivial consequence, `s1` and `t1` are such

If you don't want the length assumption, you could prove `s0 ++ t0 = s1 ++ t1 -> s0 = t0 -> s1 = t1`

I guess that follows from this pretty easily, since if `s0 = t0` then `length s0 = length t0`

Yeah, you're right! What was I thinking :stuck_out_tongue:

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (Feb 28 2018 at 03:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lists/near/123070224):
yeah it's something i'm having an issue with, I'm trying to prove that list reversal is injective from scratch

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Feb 28 2018 at 03:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lists/near/123070226):
The easiest way is to note that `reverse` is an involution

```lean
lemma rev_involutive : ∀ l : list ℕ, rev (rev l) = l
| nil := rfl
| (x::xs) := by simp [*, rev, rev_step, rev_distrib]
```

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Feb 28 2018 at 03:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/lists/near/123070293):
actually, another way, using that theorem, is to use the mirror version that assumes `length t1 = length t2`; then you get that `concat` is injective since the right parts have length 1

somebody had a prose proof in a conference paper i'm reading of how you can automatically prove injectivity of list reversal, and it's not working for me, haha

the concat def is really slick in core lib, i was trying to avoid using it

EDIT: I can't read good, they assume the lengths are equal in the pseudocode figure
