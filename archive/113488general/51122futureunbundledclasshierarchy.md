Sebastian Ullrich said (in the multiset thread)

```quote
Just idle speculation, I suppose in a future unbundled class hierarchy we would rather have an instance `is_zero âˆ… (multiset a)` instead of `has_zero (multiset a)`?
```

Does this say "in Lean 4, the whole type class system is going to change a lot"? 

I realised over the last two weeks that mathematicians think "G is a group" is a proposition, but that `Hyp : group G` is not. Maybe if a mathematician is pushed they might concede that actually it's "the pair `(G,*)` is a group" which is the proposition, but Lean still wants more (identity and inverse). I guess what I'm saying is that questions from students have made me myself question why things are set up this way.

The last bit has to do with constructivity in type theory

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698457):
Even if a function is uniquely defined in the relational sense, it's not quite the same as a function in type theory

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698464):
I thought it might do. So if someone decided to make the fundamental typeclass `is_group` we'd end up carrying around all three things (mul, inv, identity)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698510):
So while in ZFC it suffices to have (G,*) since 1 is unique, in lean you really want a concrete witness to this

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698514):
What about making `G` plus `mul` + `inv` + `1` into a structure, and making `is_group` a propositional typeclass?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698516):
In classical lean, you can nevertheless define 1 from * if you wanted, but its definitional reductions won't be great

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698524):
I'm just trying to question the way we do it, not because of groups, but because of diamonds in general. Presumably if every typeclass was a Prop the diamond problems would go away

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698526):
That option has been discussed (`group_struct` plus `is_group`)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698572):
My response is, if `group_struct` isn't useful on its own it's not worth the definition

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698575):
I was wondering whether Sebastian's comments meant that some changes would be implemented

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698582):
if every interesting `group_struct` is also a group then it may as well be bundled in the definition

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698584):
Remember there were problems with product of metric / top spaces (which I think were solved) and problems with modules over rings (which I think were not)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698590):
Can this sort of approach be used to solve them?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698596):
Sebastian's comments relate to Leo's plans with the new algebraic hierarchy

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698597):
If every interesting `group_struct` were a group, but this caused problems later down the line, then this would be an argument for not bundling.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698598):
i.e. the `@[algebra]` classes

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698601):
that's a rather vague worry

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698602):
Where do I read about Leo's plans and the `@[algebra]` classes?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698641):
there's a wiki page for it

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698644):
https://github.com/leanprover/lean/wiki/Refactoring-structures

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698654):
I remain skeptical. I will wait for Leo's implementation before considering anything along these lines

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698667):
So here we are just waiting to see what happens in Lean 4 and then we go with whatever changes get made?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698695):
pretty much

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698698):
it's not like there is any other option

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698699):
I thought that another vague plan was to get a whole bunch of maths out of core Lean

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698703):
I believe that will happen as well

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698706):
and then it's up to mathlib to decide whether it's `group` or `is_group`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698713):
It's possible that changes to `simp` will necessitate a certain design

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698767):
And it's not just "leo broke today's system", it could just as easily be "Leo's new system is way better and we would be stupid not to use it"

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 15 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698819):
I predict that most of the large scale structural changes in mathlib after lean 4 will be done because we want to take advantage of some new feature, not to fix a breaking change

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698841):
I'd seen that wiki page several times before, and my interpretation of it was "it's mostly CS stuff that I don't understand, but it documents an old change to the structure command which was already made"

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 15 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/future%20unbundled%20class%20hierarchy/near/129698852):
I now think this interpretation might be incorrect -- it might say "even though there is `use_old_structure_command` or whatever it's called, there are still some things here which are not in Lean and might in the future be in Lean"
