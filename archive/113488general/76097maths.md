<p>New users don't know that <code>#maths</code> exists. A week or so ago I was posting on <code>#maths</code> and noticed that there were some Imperial UGs whose names were greyed out on the right. This means they're not subscribed to the stream, even though they were here explicitly because I told them to come to Zulip to talk in <code>#maths</code>. Looking at it now I see that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121918">@Edward Ayers</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116065">@Hoang Le Truong</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121150">@JIANXIONG SUN</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="118106">@Ali Barkhordarian</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120634">@Anas Lasri</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120884">@Clara List</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120610">@Cosmin Stanciu</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="119741">@Fran√ßois G. Dorais</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120690">@Guillermo Barajas Ayuso</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121058">@Jasmin Blanchette</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="122362">@Karim Bacchus</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120435">@Minh Hieu Le (Kai)</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120406">@Sangwoo Jo</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116034">@William Stein</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120736">@Yulia Zaplatina</span> are all not subscribed to #maths, and for each of these people I either suspect or know for sure that they would be interested in the maths stream.</p>
<p>To anyone who notices this and is interested in watching people talking about doing maths in Lean, you can click on the cog just to the right of the word "STREAMS" on the left column and subscribe to #maths if you so desire.</p>

<p>Thank you for your information</p>

<p>Thanks Kevin! I didn't realise there were other streams!</p>

<p>Isn't this a bug? Can <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> check an option somewhere to make sure new users are subscribed to #maths and can then opt out if desired?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116065">@Hoang Le Truong</span> Are you part of the FAbstracts project, and if so, do you know if there are there other people involved in the project who also are not subscribed to #maths? You can see who is not subscribed if you go to the #maths stream, click on any message, hit reply, and then look on the right to see whose names turn grey.</p>

<p>Thanks! I forgot you also had super powers here</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  Yes I is a member of the FAbstracts project.  Since I do not meet another member but Hales, I  do not know another member of the FAbstracts project in here</p>

<p>I will ask the manager of the FAbstracts project about list of other members ofther FAbstracts project</p>

<p>Alternatively, Tom Hales could mention those people in this thread. I see him here now and then.</p>
