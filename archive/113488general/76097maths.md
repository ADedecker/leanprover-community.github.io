New users don't know that `#maths` exists. A week or so ago I was posting on `#maths` and noticed that there were some Imperial UGs whose names were greyed out on the right. This means they're not subscribed to the stream, even though they were here explicitly because I told them to come to Zulip to talk in `#maths`. Looking at it now I see that @**Edward Ayers**, @**Hoang Le Truong** @**JIANXIONG SUN** , @**Ali Barkhordarian** @**Anas Lasri**, @**Clara List** , @**Cosmin Stanciu** , @**Fran√ßois G. Dorais** , @**Guillermo Barajas Ayuso** , @**Jasmin Blanchette** , @**Karim Bacchus** , @**Minh Hieu Le (Kai)** , @**Sangwoo Jo** , @**William Stein** , @**Yulia Zaplatina** are all not subscribed to #maths, and for each of these people I either suspect or know for sure that they would be interested in the maths stream.

To anyone who notices this and is interested in watching people talking about doing maths in Lean, you can click on the cog just to the right of the word "STREAMS" on the left column and subscribe to #maths if you so desire.

Thank you for your information

Thanks Kevin! I didn't realise there were other streams!

Isn't this a bug? Can @**Sebastian Ullrich** check an option somewhere to make sure new users are subscribed to #maths and can then opt out if desired?

@**Hoang Le Truong** Are you part of the FAbstracts project, and if so, do you know if there are there other people involved in the project who also are not subscribed to #maths? You can see who is not subscribed if you go to the #maths stream, click on any message, hit reply, and then look on the right to see whose names turn grey.

@**Kevin Buzzard**  Yes I is a member of the FAbstracts project.  Since I do not meet another member but Hales, I  do not know another member of the FAbstracts project in here

I will ask the manager of the FAbstracts project about list of other members ofther FAbstracts project

Alternatively, Tom Hales could mention those people in this thread. I see him here now and then.

Cool, maybe something along these lines onto the README at https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib ?
