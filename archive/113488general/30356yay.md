I feel like having to pick a topic makes me less likely to post random garbage. Is this a good thing? Or should we have a 'party' thread? :-)

Anyway, Leo just fixed two of my issues within 24 hours (turned out they were just one issue, but hey).

I think "ASSERTION VIOLATION" is one of the things that turns his head

I'm on [6 assertion violation issues](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3Asemorrison+assertion). Gotta catch 'em all.

Oooh, and 5 more segfaults. :-)

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Mar 07 2018 at 08:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/yay/near/123386924):
that's a pretty good track record. I wonder if it's worth setting up fuzz testing for Lean
