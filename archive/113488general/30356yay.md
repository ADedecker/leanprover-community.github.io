<p>I feel like having to pick a topic makes me less likely to post random garbage. Is this a good thing? Or should we have a 'party' thread? :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, Leo just fixed two of my issues within 24 hours (turned out they were just one issue, but hey).</p>

<p>I think "ASSERTION VIOLATION" is one of the things that turns his head</p>

<p>I'm on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3Asemorrison+assertion" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3Asemorrison+assertion">6 assertion violation issues</a>. Gotta catch 'em all.</p>

<p>Oooh, and 5 more segfaults. :-)</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (Mar 07 2018 at 08:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/yay/near/123386924):
<p>that's a pretty good track record. I wonder if it's worth setting up fuzz testing for Lean</p>
