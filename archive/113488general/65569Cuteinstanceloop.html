<p>I just ran into a cute instance loop. A : if <code>K</code> is a field, it is a (finite-dimensional) vector space over itself. B : if <code>K</code> is a complete normed field, then any finite dimensional vector space over <code>K</code> is complete (I have just completed the proof of this fact). Combining these two, to prove the completeness of a normed field <code>K</code>, Lean will try to use the completeness of <code>K</code>, and loop.</p>
<p>My problem is that these two instances are natural and useful, and I would like to keep both of them. In Lean 3, if I understand correctly, I can't, and I should not register B as an instance. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span>, can you confirm that this will not be a problem in Lean 4? (Another problem with this instance in Lean 3, by the way, is that to prove the completeness of <code>E</code> Lean will start to look for an instance of <code>vector_space ?m1 E</code> for whatever <code>?m1</code>, and then it will try all the fields it knows about, and there are tons of them -- will this also be OK in Lean 4?)</p>

<p>Wait... so given a <code>normed_field K</code> that is <code>complete K</code>, you ask Lean to prove <code>complete K</code>, and it is like... yeah I know that <code>K</code> is a fin.dim vector space over this field <code>K</code>. So I can prove that <code>K</code> is complete, if this field <code>K</code> is a complete normed field. Hmmm... it's clear that <code>K</code> is a normed field, because the instance is <em>staring me right in the face</em>. Now let's see if I can prove that <code>K</code> is complete. Ooh, I know that <code>K</code> is a fin.dim vector space over... ... ...</p>

<p>Can't instances in the local context have some sort of infinite priority over instances coming from the library?</p>

<p>Oooh... never mind. It's more complicated.<br>
If you <em>don't</em> have <code>complete K</code> in your context, and you still want to infer <code>complete K</code> for some reason (maybe it is a finite field extension of something complete)... then you can still run into this loop.</p>

<p>So somehow <code>complete_of_fin_dim_over_complete</code> should never be tried for vector space = base field.</p>

<p>So we need <code>@[inference_hint := assert (¬ (E = K))]</code></p>

<p>Yes, this is very funny. For instance, asking <code>complete_space ℚ</code> loops forever (or rather, it hits <code>instance_max_depth</code> quickly). Of course, I will never ask Lean to prove that <code>ℚ</code> is complete, but this might show up in some instance search if Lean is trying the wrong path.</p>

<p>Could you show the types of these instances?</p>

<p>Whichever instance involves looking for a field metavariable sounds like it shouldn't be an instance</p>

<p>I don't think lean should always have every true relation between classes as an instance. It's not capitulation to say that some of them should be invoked explicitly</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, instance A is <code>vector_space K K &lt;- field K</code>, which seems fine, and B is <code>complete V &lt;- complete_normed_field K, vector_space K V</code> which does not look fine because the <code>K</code> is free</p>

<p>If B was <code>complete_vector_space K V</code> it wouldn't be a problem</p>

<p>But given that completeness is a property only of <code>V</code> (and its metric structure), you should already "know" that it is complete without having to do proof search to find out. That is, I would expect instances of the form <code>complete V</code> for every concrete <code>V</code> (like <code>real</code>), or it should be in the context. Perhaps we want to prove that <code>real</code> is a complete space by proving that it is a vector space over another complete field, in which case we would apply that lemma (and supply the choice of <code>K</code>), but it's not a search lean should be doing on its own</p>

<p>Hmmm... you've told us this fact many times by now. For some reason it catches me by surprise time and again. I wonder when I will finitely learn this principle.</p>
