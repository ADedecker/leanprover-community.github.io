<p>Am I correct to believe that <code>lean --make</code> and <code>lean --profile</code> are not meant to be used together? </p>
<p>When I use them together, I get this error:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::length_error: vector
</pre></div>


<p>Do people use <code>--profile</code> one file at a time?</p>

<p>I constantly use both flags together. The error message sure sounds bad.</p>

<p>I'm on Mac. What about you?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 25 2018 at 23:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124200866):
<p>Linux. I was about to ask.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 25 2018 at 23:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124200916):
<p>I'm wondering if the C++ runtime on Mac allocates less memory than on Linux. Does that sound sensible?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 25 2018 at 23:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124200957):
<p>(now I'm getting around that limitation with a Makefile)</p>

<p>(... which profiles one file at a time)</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 25 2018 at 23:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124200966):
<p>You can also use <code>--profile --recursive</code></p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 25 2018 at 23:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124201067):
<p>What's the difference with <code>--make</code>?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 25 2018 at 23:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124201114):
<p>It doesn't actually save .olean files, but I'll assume that's not that part you want to profile :)</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 25 2018 at 23:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124201118):
<p>I believe you're right :)</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 25 2018 at 23:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124201121):
<p>The bad news is that I get the same error</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 25 2018 at 23:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124201331):
<p>Well that's not good</p>

<p>About as good as the broken link to Nightly Lean Windows build :P.</p>

<p>I've been using <code>lean --profile</code> on Mac and Linux and they seem to produce different information. On Mac, I get information like:</p>

<p>while on Linux, I do not. Otherwise, the information looks the same</p>

<p>Is that normal?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 29 2018 at 12:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124361454):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> No, it should work on Linux as well</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 29 2018 at 12:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124361455):
<p>Btw, you can use <code>-D profiler.threshold=0.5</code> to suppress output &lt; 0.5s for example</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 29 2018 at 13:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124363084):
<p>thanks! Thanks should be useful! I'll try that. Any list of those fun constants?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 29 2018 at 13:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124363129):
<p>Same constants as after <code>set_option</code></p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Mar 29 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124363483):
<p>thanks! What does <code>profiler.freq</code> do?</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Mar 29 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/profiling/near/124363782):
<p>The tactic execution profile as above is computed by sampling the top-most stack frame at that frequency</p>
