I just discovered [Keep a Changlog](https://keepachangelog.com/), which reminded me of our [previous discussions](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/mathlib.20branches/near/128358255) on mathlib releases.

Mathlib is an ongoing project without releases. You probably don't want a changelog for every commit. I think Mario once suggested that one could perhaps "pretend" that there's a release on the first of every month. Perhaps the community spending 5 minutes discussing what *major* things happened in the last month or so would be a good idea! For example I believe that this month we got polynomials in one variable.
