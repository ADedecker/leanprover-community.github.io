<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I think a while back you were looking at Software Foundations using Lean. Did you write anything up?</p>

<p>Goodness knows how far they'll get</p>

<p>Interesting! What is the scope of the project? Only writing up solutions in Lean or reformulating the parts of the book that are specifically about Lean?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 01 2018 at 21:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125959222):
<p>It's one of my kids</p>

<p>so they'll just do what they want really</p>

<p>and I showed him that python had lambdas</p>

<p>and he got quite interested in them</p>

<p>One of my former undergraduate student is thinking of going through SF with Lean. Do you think that might help your son to have a studying buddy?</p>

<p>who is SF?</p>

<p>i think in general it might not be a bad idea to have a lean translation of SF</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963591):
<p>I'd volunteer to do 4-5 chapters if people were interested</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963635):
<p>That'd be great, that's true. I should probably pitch in too :D</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963642):
<p>great, you can take all the chapters that deal with tactics</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963643):

<p>I would but then there would be nothing left for you to do!</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963710):
<p>don't forget SF is 3 books now... it's a big project</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963713):
<p>I'm wondering how different the result would be from SF</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963729):
<p>I would hope that change capitals for lower cases with an underscore in front be enough but we might have rewrite some sections significantly</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963895):

<p>yes, because i taught myself lean by doing sf in lean</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963898):
<p>and there are differences</p>

<p>unfortunately i didn't keep my solutions around...</p>

<p>I have solutions for some stuff, which I was going to let my son see if he was completely lost</p>

<p>cool. i'll take a look at setting up a github repo . SF is GPL licensed so I don't think there's any issue forking it and putting it online</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965209):
<p>I'm wondering if we could team up with the SF team. I don't know if they will keep updating SF but if they do, it would be great to be notified (automatically?) so that we can adjust the Lean version too</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 00:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965331):
<p>why does that need teaming up? you could just watch their github repo</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965355):
<p>is there actually a notification system for that?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965358):
<p>Oh, yeah, ok I see. I guess we can register to get emails on commits to their repos</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 00:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965366):
<p>yeah, you can choose to receive notification emails</p>

<p>Hi all, I'm the said former undergrad (now masters) student <span class="emoji emoji-1f642" title="simple smile">:simple_smile:</span> I'm a Haske-holic coming to Lean and hope to do neat things with programming language semantics, and with system specs and models as well</p>

<p>nice. I got started on translating the first chapter of sf, basics. Everything up to chapter 11 seems pretty straightforward</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 05:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125975657):
<p>that said, even though it's straightforward, it's still work. actually, I've been spending most of my time figuring out how the sphinx documentation workflow works</p>

#### [ Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 05:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125975670):
<p>i'll have more time to devote to this after thursday</p>

<p>Let me know when you decide to show it</p>

<p>So my son will start from book 1 p1 because he's learning the entire theory from nothing but a background of python.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 02 2018 at 09:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125980928):
<p>But I'm independently interested in any sphinx tips because I want to write something about Lean for mathematicians at some point and I am still not 100% clear on the format this should take -- at the minute I am tempted to just copy TPIL but my concern is that I don't know how to display LaTeX within that set-up. Is this possible?</p>

<p>What kind of LaTeX do you want to use? Merely "equations"? Or also other fancy typesetting, like diagrams?</p>

#### [ Adam Kurkiewicz (Jul 03 2018 at 14:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020226):
<p>Hey guys, I'm working through software foundations lists chapter:<br>
<a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Lists.html#lab60" target="_blank" title="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Lists.html#lab60">https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Lists.html#lab60</a></p>
<p>After some fairly mindless pattern-matching I was able to implement a function, which can compute a sum of a list of natural numbers, and I think it basically works, but a few things seem strange:</p>
<p>1. I had to use <code>meta</code> in front of list_sum. I suspect this is something to do with recursion not necessarily being well-defined, but my PL knowledge + understanding of lean are a bit lacking, so not _really_ sure why. Any idea how to do it without <code>meta</code>?<br>
2. There's a weird thing inside the recursor inside <code>list_sum</code>, I've called it "what_is_this_for". I thought I was producing a term of type <code>nat</code>, not of type <code>nat â nat</code>, but lean disagrees. Any idea why?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inductive natlist : Type
    | nil : natlist
    | cons : nat â natlist â natlist

meta definition list_sum : natlist â nat :=
    Î» list : natlist,
    natlist.rec_on list 0 (Î» list_element : nat, Î» previous_list : natlist, Î» what_is_this_for: nat, list_element + (list_sum previous_list))

open natlist

#reduce list_sum $ cons 2 $ cons 2 nil

#eval list_sum $ cons 4 $ cons 3 $ cons 2 nil
</pre></div>

<p>What you called <code>what_is_this_for</code> is the inductive hypothesis</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020475):
<p>you should use it in place of <code>list_sum previous_list</code></p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020480):
<p>and then it won't need to be meta</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020531):
<p>Or you can just use the equation compiler instead of the recursor, and then you can make reference to the function you are defining and lean automatically compiles it to recursors</p>

#### [ Adam Kurkiewicz (Jul 03 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020743):
<p>Of course! Thank you Mario, in hindsight this is super-obvious (I think you've actually explained this to me last year in Cambridge).</p>

<p>It's definitely easier to use the equation compiler, though. <span class="emoji emoji-1f642" title="simple smile">:simple_smile:</span></p>
