@**Kevin Buzzard** I think a while back you were looking at Software Foundations using Lean. Did you write anything up?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (May 01 2018 at 21:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125959038):
I have got a work experience kid doing it for a week in July!

Goodness knows how far they'll get

Interesting! What is the scope of the project? Only writing up solutions in Lean or reformulating the parts of the book that are specifically about Lean?

so they'll just do what they want really

I'm just hoping to get them engaged with the material

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (May 01 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125959239):
because I know they'll like it

and I showed him that python had lambdas

One of my former undergraduate student is thinking of going through SF with Lean. Do you think that might help your son to have a studying buddy?

i think in general it might not be a bad idea to have a lean translation of SF

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963591):
I'd volunteer to do 4-5 chapters if people were interested

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963635):
That'd be great, that's true. I should probably pitch in too :D

great, you can take all the chapters that deal with tactics

I would but then there would be nothing left for you to do!

don't forget SF is 3 books now... it's a big project

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963713):
I'm wondering how different the result would be from SF

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 01 2018 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963729):
I would hope that change capitals for lower cases with an underscore in front be enough but we might have rewrite some sections significantly

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963895):

yes, because i taught myself lean by doing sf in lean

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 01 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125963898):
and there are differences

cool. i'll take a look at setting up a github repo . SF is GPL licensed so I don't think there's any issue forking it and putting it online

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965209):
I'm wondering if we could team up with the SF team. I don't know if they will keep updating SF but if they do, it would be great to be notified (automatically?) so that we can adjust the Lean version too

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 00:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965331):
why does that need teaming up? you could just watch their github repo

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965355):
is there actually a notification system for that?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (May 02 2018 at 00:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965358):
Oh, yeah, ok I see. I guess we can register to get emails on commits to their repos

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 00:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125965366):
yeah, you can choose to receive notification emails

Hi all, I'm the said former undergrad (now masters) student :simple_smile: I'm a Haske-holic coming to Lean and hope to do neat things with programming language semantics, and with system specs and models as well

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 05:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125975644):
nice. I got started on translating the first chapter of sf, basics. Everything up to chapter 11 seems pretty straightforward

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Andrew Ashworth (May 02 2018 at 05:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/125975657):
that said, even though it's straightforward, it's still work. actually, I've been spending most of my time figuring out how the sphinx documentation workflow works

i'll have more time to devote to this after thursday

Let me know when you decide to show it

So my son will start from book 1 p1 because he's learning the entire theory from nothing but a background of python.

But I'm independently interested in any sphinx tips because I want to write something about Lean for mathematicians at some point and I am still not 100% clear on the format this should take -- at the minute I am tempted to just copy TPIL but my concern is that I don't know how to display LaTeX within that set-up. Is this possible?

What kind of LaTeX do you want to use? Merely "equations"? Or also other fancy typesetting, like diagrams?

Hey guys, I'm working through software foundations lists chapter:
https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Lists.html#lab60

After some fairly mindless pattern-matching I was able to implement a function, which can compute a sum of a list of natural numbers, and I think it basically works, but a few things seem strange:

1. I had to use `meta` in front of list_sum. I suspect this is something to do with recursion not necessarily being well-defined, but my PL knowledge + understanding of lean are a bit lacking, so not _really_ sure why. Any idea how to do it without `meta`?
2. There's a weird thing inside the recursor inside `list_sum`, I've called it "what_is_this_for". I thought I was producing a term of type `nat`, not of type `nat → nat`, but lean disagrees. Any idea why?

```
inductive natlist : Type
    | nil : natlist
    | cons : nat → natlist → natlist

meta definition list_sum : natlist → nat :=
    λ list : natlist,
    natlist.rec_on list 0 (λ list_element : nat, λ previous_list : natlist, λ what_is_this_for: nat, list_element + (list_sum previous_list))

open natlist

#reduce list_sum $ cons 2 $ cons 2 nil

#eval list_sum $ cons 4 $ cons 3 $ cons 2 nil
```

What you called `what_is_this_for` is the inductive hypothesis

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020475):
you should use it in place of `list_sum previous_list`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020480):
and then it won't need to be meta

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jul 03 2018 at 14:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020531):
Or you can just use the equation compiler instead of the recursor, and then you can make reference to the function you are defining and lean automatically compiles it to recursors

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Adam Kurkiewicz (Jul 03 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Software%20Foundations/near/129020743):
Of course! Thank you Mario, in hindsight this is super-obvious (I think you've actually explained this to me last year in Cambridge).

Here's an alternative definition:

```lean
def natlist.sum : natlist → ℕ :=
natlist.rec 0 (λ (n : ℕ) (nl : natlist) (ih : ℕ), n + ih)
```

It's definitely easier to use the equation compiler, though. :simple_smile:

I should definitely learn to use the equation compiler, thanks guys!
