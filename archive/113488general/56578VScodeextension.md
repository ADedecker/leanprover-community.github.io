<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> could we get two variants of F12, one creating a new tab if a new file needs to be opened, and one replacing the content of the current tab, as it currently does? Also, could we get key bindings for "Go back" and "Restart Lean"? And maybe one for "Create a comment below the current line, containing what is currently in the Lean messages view"? About Lean messages, each time I press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open this tab, it also opens a copy of the file I'm currently editing. It's annoying and I think it wasn't like this before.</p>

<p>alt-left should be a key binding for "go back"</p>

<p>I also noticed the bug with ctrl-shift-enter opening a copy over the message view</p>

<p>You can set your key bindings yourself btw</p>

<p>It makes me think I would really love to know a way to ask VScode to trigger translation immediately rather than waiting for a blank space of movement. It would really help to type words containing several special unicode characters.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jul 25 2018 at 12:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130267893):
<p>How do you setup keybindings?</p>

<p>file &gt; prefs &gt; key shortcuts</p>

<p>But how would you deal with prefixes? Such as <code>\t</code> vs <code>\to</code>?</p>

<p>this is what emacs does</p>

<p>I think if you type <code>\t</code> you get the triangle but underlined, and typing <code>o</code> changes it to an arrow</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jul 25 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130268013):
<p>I don't need it to be automatic, I want to be able to <em>ask</em> for it before VScode decides it should do it anyway</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jul 25 2018 at 12:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130268026):
<p>Sweet. So if I would type <code>\Zp</code> would that give me â„¤p?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 25 2018 at 12:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130268033):
<p>I believe so</p>

<p>I think vscode does the same in that case</p>

<p><del>ctrl+k f12</del> the default keybinding does not work here</p>
<p>But you can assign "open definition to the side" to whatever keybinding you like.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Currently F12 and other navigation commands only replace the content of the current tab if you are viewing a file in temporary mode, indicated with italics in the tab title</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jul 25 2018 at 12:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130268182):
<p>you can clear temporary mode by clicking on the title or editing anywhere</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Go back"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ctrl+alt+- is the default keybinding.  I usually use the vim keybindings, where it is ctrl+t as expected.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out "open definition to the side". But it opens in the area containing Lean messages :(</p>

<p>Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open this tab, it also opens a copy of the file I'm currently editing</p>

<p>Oh, that seems to be a new bug with vscode 1.25.  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/issues/77" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/issues/77">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/issues/77</a></p>

<p>You can split the editor first with ctrl+\</p>

<p>Thanks, but this creates a whole new zone, not a new tab in the current group</p>

<p>Oh, that italic filename is a really subtle clue. I never noticed it</p>

<p>It's lunchtime, but I'm happy I've learned a lot of VScode tricks</p>

<p>I'm currently having a bit of trouble publishing the vscode extension, so you'll have to wait a bit for the update.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jul 25 2018 at 16:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130278254):
<p>Thanks! Hopefully this example could serve as a pattern for other stuff like that (I have nothing specific in mind).</p>

<p>I just pushed the update.  Please tell me if I broke anything.</p>

<p>I managed to escape.  The only new feature is "ctrl+shift+p copy contents to comment", which copies the current content of the info view to a comment below the current line, as requested by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>.</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Jul 27 2018 at 23:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130435618):
<p>One slightly annoying new feature of VSCode, is that when I click "Display Goal", it opens the file I have open in the right pane. Is there a way to do anything about that?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Jul 27 2018 at 23:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130435636):
<p>I've added a feature in emacs (taken from <code>company-coq</code>) to use <code>diff</code> to compare the actual / expected types in error messages. Any chance I might convince you to add it to VS code or help me implement it for VS code?</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jul 28 2018 at 09:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130455350):
<blockquote>

<p>This bug should be fixed with yesterday's update.</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jul 28 2018 at 09:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130455926):
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure, I am happy about new features.  How did you extract the expected/actual type from the error message?  Regex?</p>
<p>If you want to implement it yourself, look at how <code>_lean.revealPosition</code> is implemented in the info view (this handles the click on the message title and scrolls to the corresponding position in the file): <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/b872639347221a0146bf4e98234ee55e3d634b30/src/infoview.ts#L375" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/b872639347221a0146bf4e98234ee55e3d634b30/src/infoview.ts#L375">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/b872639347221a0146bf4e98234ee55e3d634b30/src/infoview.ts#L375</a><br>
I think we can add a link to the diff right next to it.  You can show the diff with <code>workspace.openTextDocument</code> and <code>window.showTextDocument</code>.  Feel free to add a diff library to the dependencies.</p>

<p>I tried installing the lean VScode update, and now opening VScode instantly freezes my computer. Anyone else experiencing this problem?</p>

<p>If I find the extension in VS code I am only offered "disable" and "uninstall". I seem to be on version 0.11.11 (and on Ubuntu)</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 28 2018 at 12:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130460257):
<p>I have extension auto-update on. Which version of the extension are you having problems with? You're talking about a Windows machine right?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jul 28 2018 at 12:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130460304):
<p>More to the point -- the bug is fixed for me and I have no problems with the extension. So I guess I upgraded safely. Anyone on Windows having the same problems with...Chris? Are you on 0.11.11? Oh -- you can't even tell?</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Jul 28 2018 at 12:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130460321):

<p>As a temporary measure you can uninstall the lean extension and then try and figure out how to install an older version. I can't reproduce here on linux; things are working fine for me. Can you switch logging on somehow? This might happen to every Windows user who has auto-update on.</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jul 28 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VScode%20extension/near/130461142):
<p>I just tried to reproduce on windows, but everything works for me.  (elan is completely broken for me though)</p>

<p>Chris can you switch on some debugging output, have the current extension loaded, and then open a Lean file? What happens exactly after you open a lean file? You said your computer freezes? What OS are you using? Win7 or Win10?</p>

<p>If everything else fails, can you try to reinstall vscode and lean completely.  I am really at a loss here, there are almost no changes between vscode-lean 0.11.9 and 0.11.11, and none that look in any way dangerous.  I am running the lean 3.4.1 release on windows 10 and vscode 1.25.1 here.</p>

<p>What I did is split the error message into lines and find the line that says <code>"has type:"</code> and I take everything until I find the line announcing the expected type.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with this and I can do <code>#eval</code>, <code>#check</code> just fine, but the second I type <code>lemma</code> or <code>theorem</code>, Lean eats all my memory and hits disc to the point the system can't recover. Surprisingly enough <code>example</code> doesn't crash it.</p>

<p>Actually it's VS Code that does that (unsurprisingly), because when I close the lean subprocess of VS-code parent, it doesn't fix anything.</p>

<p>Yes, that's just swapping and it's because of the high memory usage.  The operating system just moves some stuff from RAM to HDD in order to make space.</p>

<p>Negligable if I can even get it to update. The thing is, when I type <code>lemma</code> and I close VS within a second, it recovers. When I type <code>lemma</code> and I close just the <code>lean</code> subprocess of the tree, it doesn't recover. It's gigabytes of memory instantly for VSCode and some dozens of megabytes for lean.</p>

<p>I'm just saying that most points on the list are either infeasible right now, or shouldn't go into the vscode extension.<br>
If you want to start experimenting right now, I think the naming convention automation is the lowest hanging fruit.  You can implement <code>#how_do_you_call âˆ€ x y, x &lt; y â†’ x - y = 0</code> as a user command for example.</p>

<p>The next best is maybe "turn current goal into lemma".  You can do this as a tactic that outputs the text for the lemma as an error message.  The user can then copy&amp;paste it where they want.  Last time I talked with Rob and Johannes there was the suggestion to parse tags like <code>&lt;insert-above&gt;lemma foo : a â†’ b := sorry&lt;/insert-above&gt;</code> in the error messages, but imho that's a bit too hacky unless there is a significant need for it.</p>

Kevin told me that I should warn you about this, since there's a chance that whatever caused this might be in the next windows update (which google says is on October 10th).

<p>Well, the two features are completely independent.<br>
For the "pause" feature, I think the easiest way would be prevent syncing the file contents here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/d70dfa121bc616100c14bc0fd24400b9962922da/src/sync.ts#L36" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/d70dfa121bc616100c14bc0fd24400b9962922da/src/sync.ts#L36">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/d70dfa121bc616100c14bc0fd24400b9962922da/src/sync.ts#L36</a>  You'd probably also want to disable autocompletion, hover, go-to-definition, etc. in that mode.<br>
Add a command to toggle the pause flag, and when unsetting it, resync all files.  There is theoretically also an option in the roi setting (press on the Lean item in the status bar, and then select "nothing"); but the server still recompiles stuff for autocompletion etc.</p>
