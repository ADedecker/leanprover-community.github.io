<p>In <a href="http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf">http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf</a>, section 3, Freek Wiedijk gives four statements as small benchmark of how usable a proof assistent is for mathematicians. How does Lean fare here? My impression is that we don't have any trouble with (2) and (3). For (1), I don't think we currently have such a nice syntax for integrals and infinite sums, but we can probably get close. (4) is something that I don't know anything about.</p>

<p>Coming from the Coq world, the issue he points out for Mizar with respect to 1 is indeed probably unlikely to be a problem, since it is not a problem in Coq. But the real subtlety (which I expect to happen also in Lean) is that the proof that consists of a chain of equalities like that in Coq wouldn't <em>mean</em> what Mathematicians usually think. In order for rewriting by a chain of equalities to be conveinient, it usually means setting things up so that it would say "if the integral exists, then it is equal to that", whereas  most mathematicians would probably read that chain of arguments as a claim about the existence of the integral as well</p>

<p>It's amusing to look at the 100 theorems table in that paper though. It doesn't even mention MetaMath, a lot has changed!</p>

<p>I think his concerns about classical reasoning in Coq are kind of misdirected. It's not so much a systems issue, but the big libraries aren't designed to support it. The mathcomp-analysis project is mostly (or entirely?) classical from what I understand. Given Mario, Jesse, and Floris' set theory work, I don't see why 4 should be an issue in theory. And it should be possible to do something analogous in Coq.</p>

<p>Yeah, the 4 axioms he lists are basically sufficient in my experience :D. The real issue is that sociologically, many Coq people seem to strive to use as few such axioms as possible. (For example, the Coquelicot library that pre-dated mathcomp-analysis goes out of its way to use as weak of classical axioms as possible)</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's always fun to look back at some of the Automath literature and see how little has changed. <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2039924/256169.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2039924/256169.pdf">https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2039924/256169.pdf</a></p>

<p>Indeed, which means he has a fine answer for why Coq didn't fulfill the QED vision, but not for why it couldn't. Which I think is more what he was trying to argue.</p>
