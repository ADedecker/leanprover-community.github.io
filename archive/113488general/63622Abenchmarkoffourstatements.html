<p>In <a href="http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf">http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf</a>, section 3, Freek Wiedijk gives four statements as small benchmark of how usable a proof assistent is for mathematicians. How does Lean fare here? My impression is that we don't have any trouble with (2) and (3). For (1), I don't think we currently have such a nice syntax for integrals and infinite sums, but we can probably get close. (4) is something that I don't know anything about.</p>

<p>Coming from the Coq world, the issue he points out for Mizar with respect to 1 is indeed probably unlikely to be a problem, since it is not a problem in Coq. But the real subtlety (which I expect to happen also in Lean) is that the proof that consists of a chain of equalities like that in Coq wouldn't <em>mean</em> what Mathematicians usually think. In order for rewriting by a chain of equalities to be conveinient, it usually means setting things up so that it would say "if the integral exists, then it is equal to that", whereas  most mathematicians would probably read that chain of arguments as a claim about the existence of the integral as well</p>

<p>I think his concerns about classical reasoning in Coq are kind of misdirected. It's not so much a systems issue, but the big libraries aren't designed to support it. The mathcomp-analysis project is mostly (or entirely?) classical from what I understand. Given Mario, Jesse, and Floris' set theory work, I don't see why 4 should be an issue in theory. And it should be possible to do something analogous in Coq.</p>

<p>Yeah, the 4 axioms he lists are basically sufficient in my experience :D. The real issue is that sociologically, many Coq people seem to strive to use as few such axioms as possible. (For example, the Coquelicot library that pre-dated mathcomp-analysis goes out of its way to use as weak of classical axioms as possible)</p>

<p>Indeed, which means he has a fine answer for why Coq didn't fulfill the QED vision, but not for why it couldn't. Which I think is more what he was trying to argue.</p>

<p>Don't try Automatic Theorem Proving</p>
<p>Prefer the use of TYPED SETS, but don't forbid untyped sets</p>
<p>Don't put logic in the system; let the user start his books with it.</p>

<p>There are several equivalent definitions, some of which are more closer to reach, but these are not the ones that are useful in proving that the relevant forcings for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4">#4</a> are proper. Closer to reach is that Martin's Axiom for forcings of size Aleph_1 implies the negation of CH since the ccc is straight forward to define and the relevant proof of ccc mostly involves just one combinatorial trick.</p>

<p>I just read that Wikipedia article and I see that they only give one definition. The definition given there is most useful to prove that forcings are not proper. The most versatile one is perhaps the existence of master conditions, as detailed in Uri Abraham's handbook article IIRC. Shelah has a slick game theoretic definition that one could probably write down in Lean pretty quickly, but that definition is mostly a curiosity.</p>

<p>right, MA is easy to shallowly state in Lean, but i made my earlier claim because it's not clear to me how one would state "proper forcing" for a partially ordered type; the rest of PFA is fine.</p>
<p>in principle, if we had the ZFC proof tree for "PFA implies not CH" we could replay it in Lean's canonical model <code>pSet</code> of ZFC and then use the fact that Lean's (external) cardinals are isomorphic to  <code>pSet</code>'s cardinals to conclude "if PFA holds in Lean's canonical model of ZFC, then CH is false for Lean's cardinals"</p>
<p>but this is different from an intrinsic statement of PFA in Lean</p>
<p>ah i see you beat me to the punch. if there's a definition of "proper forcing" which avoids an implicit quantification over forcing extensions then that should be fine.</p>

<p>There is never any need to quantity over forcing extensions, all of that can be done in the forcing language, which is in the ground model.</p>

<p>i thought you might say that :P</p>
<p>it's not really clear to me what the right definition of the forcing language of a partially ordered type is</p>
<p>there's the <code>bSet</code> construction which gives you a proper class of P-names, but then one is essentially working with a forcing extension</p>

<p>The P-names are ground model sets, so they're not a problem. The tough part is defining the forcing language, specifically the atomic relations for membership and equality, which is traditionally done as a mutual transfinite recursion.</p>
