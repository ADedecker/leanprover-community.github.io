#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391693):
<p>What am I meant to do with old PRs, that I had pushed as branches on leanprover-community/mathlib?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391749):
<p>It seems I can no longer push to them, which is probably an intentional effect of the new maintainer setup.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391761):
<p>Should I close those PRs and make new ones from my own fork?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 01 2019 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391793):
<p>I believe you should change the remote to the fork and push them there</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391795):
<p>I should I still be able to push to non-master branches?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 01 2019 at 23:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391806):
<p>And for the new PR's you can push them to the non-master branches</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391862):
<p>I'm confused. Are you saying that I can make new branches on leanprover-community/mathlib, but can't push to old branches?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 01 2019 at 23:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157391882):
<p>I'm saying that for old PR's, you can change the remote to the backup fork and push them there (if you push without changing remote, you'll create a new branch in leanprover-community/mathlib); for new PR's push to leanprover-community/mathlib directly</p>

<p>I second <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span>'s suggestion</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157392361):
<p>It seems I can't push to leanprover-community/mathlib anymore?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 01 2019 at 23:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157392404):
<p>you should be able to...</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 01 2019 at 23:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/github/near/157392566):
<p>I'd missed the invitation. All good now.</p>
