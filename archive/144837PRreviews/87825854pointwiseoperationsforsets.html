<p>It's very exciting to see the avalanche of merges. I guess it took an April Fools Day for everyone to recover from their ITP deadline... Is there anyone who wants to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/854" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/854">#854</a>? It only adds a file to mathlib. I purposely didn't make things instances, because "there is more than one way to do it". (You can have several reasonable multiplications of sets.)</p>

<p>I think I'll let the people assigned to it review it</p>

<p>btw, I think you merged the same three branches a bunches of time today. I'm thinking it might have been excessive.</p>
