#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148369750):
Okay, I had a few moments to think about this. Here's a short solution using `fconstructor` that will handle multi-argument constructors and nested single-arg constructors together, like @**Mario Carneiro** wanted. I'm not quite sure about the failure conditions though. This will fail if you give it too many arguments, which I think is correct. It will succeed if you give it too few arguments, potentially leaving you in the middle of a partially applied multi-arg constructor. Reasonable?

```lean
meta def tactic.use : list pexpr → tactic unit 
| [] := skip
| (h::t) := ((focus1 (refine h >> done)) <|> (fconstructor >> focus1 (refine h >> done)) <|> 
    fail format!"failed to instantiate goal with {h}") >> tactic.use t

meta def tactic.interactive.use' (l : interactive.parse interactive.types.pexpr_list_or_texpr) : tactic unit :=
tactic.use l >> try reflexivity

inductive foo 
| mk : ℕ → bool × ℕ → ℕ → foo

example : foo :=
by use' [100, tt, 4, 3]

example : foo :=
by use' [100, tt, tt, 3]
/-
failed to instantiate goal with tt
state:
2 goals
⊢ ℕ

⊢ ℕ
-/
```

I like this behavior

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148369891):
Hmm, the interactive wrapper should probably start with a `focus1`, otherwise it will try to touch later goals if you give it too many arguments.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370027):
why does it end with `try reflexivity`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370039):
Trying reflexivity is always good

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370097):
Because Patrick requested it in the original discussion and it doesn't really hurt.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370104):
if it's just exploratory it should be `reflexivity reducible`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370112):
like in `rw`

What does this mean?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370129):
Yeah, good point.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370146):
that it won't try super hard when it's not appropriate

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370185):
Ok, let's see how proofs will break then

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370189):
(hopefully none)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370241):
worst case you have to `use x; refl`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 15:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370276):
this is what I hoped to avoid, but it may be too costly

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370307):
plus `eq` is itself a single arg constructor, so can't you add more things to the `use` to trigger it?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370346):
it's not clear to me that we always follow a `use` by a `refl` though

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370348):
The only example from the old discussion that breaks is this one, and it works if you add `rfl` to the use.
```lean
example : ∃ a b c : ℤ, a + b + c = 6 :=
by use' [1, 2, 3, rfl]
```

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370408):
it seems like only somewhat contrived examples... like that one... have this characteristic

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370447):
I'd be happy to try without the strong reflexivity try

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370463):
usually it's like `\ex a b c, x = f a b c /\ properties of a, b,c`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370658):
I guess if the equality is the last thing it could still work, provided you don't want the properties as subgoals

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148370743):
I don't think trying `reflexivity reducible` at the end hurts, and (maybe only very) occasionally it leads to some nice short proofs. But I'm not committed to keeping it.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371039):
I think it's fine to keep, I just doubt it will help

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371145):
is there a low attempting version of `trivial`? I think finishing with some zero arg constructors, including `eq.refl` and `trivial`, could be very helpful in this context

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 15:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371172):
I think mathematicians find ending a proof with `refl` ugly. It would be nice if we could just write `.` instead of `rfl`/`refl`, that would be nice. But of course I'm whining about icing on the cake right now.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 15:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371193):
And maybe `end` should always attempt to close all remaining goals by `refl` or some similar cheap automation.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 15:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371205):
Then you can just stop proving after giving the essential ideas.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371247):
Maybe we should define `triv'` that uses `exact reducible` instead of just `exact`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 15:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371279):
does `exact` have a reducibility setting?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371295):
Yeah.

that makes sense

does `triv` exist? It should be an alias for `trivial`

if not we can nab it for ourselves

`tactic.triv` is in core.

no interactive though?

Okay, so should we make `tactic.interactive.triv` a version of `tactic.interactive.trivial` that takes a reducibility parameter? Or make it explicitly the low cost one?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Nov 26 2018 at 15:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23486%20use/near/148371587):
That kind of makes sense, shorter name = don't try as hard.

BTW, a better version of `tactic.use`:
```lean

 You meant `obviously` there, didn't you?  :-)

I got distracted yesterday afternoon and just came back to this. The logic of that last version wasn't quite right when things were nested. This is better. https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/497
