#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148366689):
<p>I'm far from an expert on simp-lemmology, so please teach me. Given a lemma like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>@[simp] theorem succ_singleton (n : â„•) : Ico n (n+1) = singleton n :=
</pre></div>


<p>should the right hand side be <code>singleton n</code> or <code>{n}</code>?</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148366908):
<p>I think you need to check whether there are other simp lemma whose left-hand side is either <code>{n}</code> or <code>singleton n</code>, hoping for <code>simp</code> to chain</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367080):
<p>I didn't pay enough attentionto the existence of this PR. It would be nice to merge efforts with my <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean</a></p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367109):
<p>This file is a mess (hence the name), but it contains quite a bit of lemmas about interval of integers</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 14:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367171):
<p>it should be <code>singleton n</code>. As Patrick says, the thing to look for when there are alternate ways to write a term is a simp lemma rewriting one into the other; in that case the one on the right is the "simp normal form" version</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367180):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> The PR is only 4 hours old. So you can hardly be at fault for not paying enough attention.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367192):
<p>Oh!</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367202):
<p>I switched off github emails because it was overwhelming, but there are downsides</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367204):
<p>Also it explicitly invites others to contribute. So there you go.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367250):
<p>What is the downside? Now you get notified by someone posting in this stream.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367279):
<p>Mario, would you be able to gather enough courage to go through that <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean</a> and remove what's already in mathlib or stupidly long proofs?</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367297):
<p>I could push that file somewhere to the community repository of course</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367309):
<p>Actually I wondered whether I should create a bigop branch in mathlib instead of using my repository</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367383):
<p>I think you should.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367799):
<p>This repository was created long before the community repository (and also nobody else cared about bigop at that time)</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148368077):
<p>Sure, of course. I also moved my <code>simplicial</code> stuff into a branch of the community repo. I think we should move as much there as possible. I hope it encourages collaboration.</p>
