#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148366689):
I'm far from an expert on simp-lemmology, so please teach me. Given a lemma like
```
@[simp] theorem succ_singleton (n : â„•) : Ico n (n+1) = singleton n :=
```
should the right hand side be `singleton n` or `{n}`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148366908):
I think you need to check whether there are other simp lemma whose left-hand side is either `{n}` or `singleton n`, hoping for `simp` to chain

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367080):
I didn't pay enough attentionto the existence of this PR. It would be nice to merge efforts with my https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367109):
This file is a mess (hence the name), but it contains quite a bit of lemmas about interval of integers

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 26 2018 at 14:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367171):
it should be `singleton n`. As Patrick says, the thing to look for when there are alternate ways to write a term is a simp lemma rewriting one into the other; in that case the one on the right is the "simp normal form" version

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367180):
@**Patrick Massot** The PR is only 4 hours old. So you can hardly be at fault for not paying enough attention.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367192):
Oh!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367202):
I switched off github emails because it was overwhelming, but there are downsides

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367204):
Also it explicitly invites others to contribute. So there you go.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367250):
What is the downside? Now you get notified by someone posting in this stream.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367279):
Mario, would you be able to gather enough courage to go through that https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/pending_lemmas.lean and remove what's already in mathlib or stupidly long proofs?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367297):
I could push that file somewhere to the community repository of course

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367309):
Actually I wondered whether I should create a bigop branch in mathlib instead of using my repository

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367383):
I think you should.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 26 2018 at 14:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148367799):
This repository was created long before the community repository (and also nobody else cared about bigop at that time)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 26 2018 at 14:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23496%20Ico/near/148368077):
Sure, of course. I also moved my `simplicial` stuff into a branch of the community repo. I think we should move as much there as possible. I hope it encourages collaboration.
