<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> Could you remind us in a few short sentences why <code>roption nat</code> was better than <code>with_top nat</code>?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Dec 17 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051296):
<p>Because a lot of the algebraic structure has already been developed for <code>with_top</code>, I think...</p>

<p>I guess <code>enat</code> also has the algebraic structure...</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Dec 17 2018 at 19:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051467):
<p>Sure it does... but now it has to be redeveloped from scratch</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Dec 17 2018 at 20:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051533):
<p>Anyway, it looks good to me. I suggested to add a newline to the end of a file. Don't know what the official policy is there, but it makes Github happy (-;</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Dec 17 2018 at 20:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051598):
<p>it's for computation reasons</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Dec 17 2018 at 20:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051692):
<p>I see. So at some point in the future we will have <code>with_rtop</code> and <code>with_rbot</code> and <code>with_rzero</code>?</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Dec 17 2018 at 20:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051878):
<p>It's computable when the predicate that says whether it returns <code>some</code> or <code>none</code> is undecidable</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Dec 17 2018 at 20:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152052240):
<p>not likely. <code>enat</code> is a bit of a special case</p>
