@**Chris Hughes** Could you remind us in a few short sentences why `roption nat` was better than `with_top nat`?

Because a lot of the algebraic structure has already been developed for `with_top`, I think...

I guess `enat` also has the algebraic structure...

Sure it does... but now it has to be redeveloped from scratch

Anyway, it looks good to me. I suggested to add a newline to the end of a file. Don't know what the official policy is there, but it makes Github happy (-;

it's for computation reasons

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Dec 17 2018 at 20:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23522%20enat/near/152051692):
I see. So at some point in the future we will have `with_rtop` and `with_rbot` and `with_rzero`?

It's computable when the predicate that says whether it returns `some` or `none` is undecidable

not likely. `enat` is a bit of a special case
