Hi @**Johan Commelin**, is it a good idea to define over and under categories in terms of comma categories?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Dec 21 2018 at 11:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23549%20over%20categories/near/152321844):
It is certainly less ergonomic that just defining them from scratch.

So the question is if things are actually defeq enough that you can use theorems about comma categories directly.

If they aren't, I'd suggest biting the bullet and making them separate, and explicitly showing at equivalence.

But I'm not sure, and can't tell just from looking at the PR.

Well, so far I haven't had much problems with using this definition. So I like it (-;

@**Scott Morrison|110087** You say that it is less ergonomic than defining from scratch. Otoh I think almost every line that I wrote would need an equivalent line in the "from scratch" definition (all the simp-lemmas). And lines such as
```lean
def forget {X : T} : (over X) тед T := comma.fst _ _
```
can hardly be shorter when defining things from scratch. So far I haven't really felt like I was battling generality.

Oh, I agree that it's exactly as much effort for this PR. The question is how it differs to users. In particular the "from scratch" approach means users might not need to worry about filling in 'unit.star' in a few places.

But I'm not at all confident about this.

@**Reid Barton** What do you think?
