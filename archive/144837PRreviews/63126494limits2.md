#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 29 2018 at 18:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148802831):
Is there anything blocking this PR?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 29 2018 at 18:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148802968):
Aah, I see there is still an open comment by Mario on the Github discussion.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 29 2018 at 18:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148802984):
@**Reid Barton** Do you plan fixing that? Or shall I try it?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 29 2018 at 22:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148821683):
I've fixed it.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 09:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148847373):
Thanks, Scott!

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148863597):
@**Mario Carneiro** When you last looked at this PR, what was your impression? Anything serious besides your comment on the Github page?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864254):
Hmm, Travis reports the following error
```
/home/travis/build/leanprover/mathlib/category_theory/equivalence.lean:247:4: error: tactic failed, there are no goals to be solved
state:
no goals
external command exited with status 1
The command "leanpkg test" exited with 1.
```

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864307):
@**Reid Barton** Shall I fix this? Or would you rather limit (pun fully intended) the number of people meddling with these PR branches?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864368):
`equivalence.lean` should not even exist on the `limits-2` branch though?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864458):
Or were equivalences merged and I forgot?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864512):
I think there was a separate PR on them

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864520):
Ah, maybe I didn't notice and then this got rebased?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864531):
I added some simp lemmas about isomorphisms, so the error isn't too surprising

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864582):
These are my favourite kind of errors, where Lean proved something before a tactic block was finished...

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864661):
I'm actually surprised `simp` can't handle `equivalence.trans` on its own now

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864784):
Does travis automatically rebase before building?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864816):
You should ask our local Travis expert. (I have no clue who this is.)

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864838):
I guess it must, since as far as I can tell the PR itself hasn't been rebased

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148864841):
I will try to fix this

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866379):
I should take this opportunity to remind people that doing things after `simp` is a bad idea if you want your proof to be stable.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866400):
Sometimes it can be a least of evils, but starting your proofs with `dsimp, simp, ...` is not a good default.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866521):
In this case luckily there was no compilcated breakage, only the one case where a goal was closed and so the rest of the proof could be deleted. But stuff like https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/category_theory/equivalence.lean#L215 is scary, a new simp lemma can affect the rest of that proof in ways that are hard to predict.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 16:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866525):
In case of emergency, one can always use the workflow: type `simp`, see new goal G, replace `simp` by `suffices : G, by simp[this],` which should work most of the times

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866597):
I have proofs where I do things after `tidy`. I guess that is a capital sin?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866630):
The original limits PR had a lot of these proofs, which I replaced with mostly one-liners

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866672):
But I guess almost all those proofs ought to be killed by `tidy` + `rewrite_search`, right?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866727):
Probably, but we don't have rewrite_search yet (and I would guess it's super slow?)

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 16:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866777):
Remember we still hope to be able to have `tidy` + `rewrite_search` output a proof script that Lean can check quickly. It won't be pretty in the source code, but won't be long to type

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866794):
Right, which is sort of what we have right now. The problem is that script uses `simp`

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866797):
But that proof script might not be stable.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866845):
Which is why we need (multi-layer) caching.

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 16:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866852):
Then we need to use `simp_squeeze` inside `tidy`

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866864):
So I think this is fixable if we can avoid `simp`, or figure out what it did and do it manually (maybe using Patrick's method)

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 16:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866883):
`simp only` is much more stable than `simp`

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 16:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866907):
Yes,  I haven't looked at `simp_squeeze` yet, but it sounds like a good solution

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866924):
(By the way, it is `squeeze_simp` from `tactic.squeeze`.)

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 16:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866970):
indeed

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 16:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/148866997):
I don't remember if it also provides a `squeeze_dsimp`

#### [ Johan Commelin (Dec 01 2018 at 11:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150678673):
@**Kevin Buzzard** This is the current PR.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Dec 02 2018 at 06:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150710552):
@**Kevin Buzzard** do they do all colimits? Filtered colimits? Products? Binary products? Eventually I think we'll want individual implementations of all of these, for an important category like CommRing.

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Dec 02 2018 at 10:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150717516):
All colimits

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Dec 02 2018 at 12:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150720637):
I'm ready to merge this, but there are some trivial merge conflicts in this branch

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Dec 02 2018 at 13:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150722194):
Just to flesh out what was going on here -- I knew that arbitrary colimits would follow from something like coproducts and pushouts, but it seemed to me that all three of these constructions (colimits, coproducts, pushouts) were "the same" -- they were all "build a multivariate polynomial ring with coefficients the disjoint union of the rings you're starting with, and then quotient out by some ideal". For the pushouts and coproducts the generators of the ideal were just a subset of the generators for the general case, so we just did the general case.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Dec 02 2018 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150739265):
@**Mario Carneiro**, I think Reid may have already fixed this (it looks like he rearranged the history some last night), but I've just doublechecked that it's rebased onto master, and I've squashed and re-messaged a few commits. (We might consider merging this one without squashing any further, as Reid did a nice job of arranging the PR into a sensible linear sequence of commits.)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Dec 02 2018 at 23:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23494%20limits-2/near/150739398):
Hooray!
