@**Kevin Buzzard** @**Mario Carneiro** `pow` comes for free after I've proved semiring! :D

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 13:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146936223):
and about `map`: I don't really see how useful it would be @**Johan Commelin**

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 13:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146936726):
@**Mario Carneiro** why don't we prove that `submodule.map` and `submodule.comap` form a galois connection?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Nov 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146936749):
sure, it's one line

I mean, why didn't we?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 13:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146936763):
you could derive some other theorems from this galois connection, right?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 07 2018 at 13:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146937375):
@**Kenny Lau** I think `map` will be very useful. If `I : ideal R` and `f : R → S` you see mathematicians writing `I.S` all the time for the ideal generated by `I` in `S`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Nov 07 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146937400):
`comap` is used to show that `Spec` is a functor.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 07 2018 at 13:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146937405):
And implicitly we are using all the time that it behaves well in certain ways. Which are exactly the little lemmas in the beginning of A–MD.

@**Kevin Buzzard** @**Johan Commelin** added `map`. this might be the only time I use `ge` instead of `le`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 14:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146940426):

Right, I think integral closure would be a reasonable next step.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 07 2018 at 16:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146965271):
I mean, regarding this PR

Ok, so it is not some sort of index of a submodule.

Aah, of course.

Ok, Kenny. We need to be able to write the I^n\cdots D that is at the very bottom of Page 73  of https://www2.math.uni-paderborn.de/fileadmin/Mathematik/People/wedhorn/Lehre/AdicSpaces.pdf

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 07 2018 at 16:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23462%20ideal%20operations/near/146965491):
So, this looks like the fractional quotient, but it isn't exactly that, right?

Hmmm, there quite a lot of abuse of notation going on there...

I is an ideal and D is a subring (except that I is an ideal not in the same ring as D)

@**Johan Commelin** AM calls it quotient, but I don’t think we want this name in Lean

Speaking of localisations: @**Kenny Lau** we couldn't find the fact that `s : S` becomes a unit in the localisation.

`I` is an ideal in a subring `A₀` of a ring `A`. We localise at an element `s : A` so we get `A → A_s`. Inside this, we look at `D` which is the subring generated by the image of `A₀` and some elements we don't care about.

With this information, the reader is supposed to figure out what `I^n • D` is. I would be surprised if Lean could do so as well.
