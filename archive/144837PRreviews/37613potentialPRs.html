<p>I don't know if this is a good place to propose potential PR's before working on them. If not, let me know. In any case, I have three to suggest.</p>
<p>(1) Silvia de Toffoli recently asked me to show her the clearest, most intuitive formalization of the mutilated checkerboard problem I could. This is what I came up with: <a href="https://gist.github.com/avigad/1080e327ad6806884c9c5091f5c449bd" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/avigad/1080e327ad6806884c9c5091f5c449bd">https://gist.github.com/avigad/1080e327ad6806884c9c5091f5c449bd</a>. Is this worth putting in mathlib? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span>  recently formalized the Littlewood problem on cubes, which is much more impressive. I couldn't find that in the library, but did I miss it? If not, we could create a 'combinatorics' folder for both of these.</p>
<p>(2) On <code>finset</code>, we use <code>bind s f</code> or <code>s.bind f</code> for the union of <code>f x</code> as <code>x</code> ranges over <code>s</code>. This would scare any mathematician away. By analogy to the version on <code>set</code>, we could call it <code>bUnion s f</code> for 'bounded union'. How do people feel about that change? I can also look into introducing the bounded union notation, but I worry that it will conflict with the set theory notation in a bad way.</p>
<p>(On <code>finset</code> we also use the notation <code>filter s p</code> for the set of <code>x</code> in <code>s</code> satisfying <code>p</code>. There is a generic typeclass <code>sep</code> that handles that on <code>set</code>, but, alas, we cannot use that for <code>finset</code> because the <code>finset</code> version requires a typeclass instance for decidable equality. So I would be inclined to stick with <code>filter</code>.)</p>
<p>(3) The library has an empty <code>pending</code> folder. Does that serve a purpose any more? If not, shall we delete it?</p>
