#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 19 2019 at 22:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23567/near/156452337):
https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/567

This is my PR which includes a formalization of basic probability theory - including Bayes theorem. I intend to make this a foundation for defining random variables, properties of random variables and in particular, a normally distributed random variable.

I currently defined a `probability_measure` as extending the `measure_theory.measure`, which maps into `ennreal`. @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl**  requested me to redefine this as mapping into `nnreal` or `real`. But if I do this, it is breaking a lot of proofs and I am unable to directly use the `measure_theory` library results already proven.  Maybe there is a clever way of redefining it which avoids these issues, but I am a beginner and am unable to figure it out. 

I just wanted suggestions on how to proceed with this.
