<p>Okay, here is limits and colimits (just for general shapes, not all the useful special cases yet), with no dependency on new-fangled tactics.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/416" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/416">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/416</a></p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 13 2018 at 20:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135741575):
<p>I've now added all the special shapes (although equalizers and pullbacks are less developed than everything else).</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 13 2018 at 20:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135741583):
<p>I also added instances for (co)limits in <code>Type u</code>, and appropriate simp lemmas.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 13 2018 at 20:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135741588):
<p>I'm happy for this to be reviewed/merged at this point, I don't have immediate plans to add more.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 13 2018 at 20:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135741667):
<p>A few missing bits if anyone wants to fill them in:</p>
<ul>
<li>lemmas describing how equalizers and pullbacks (and the dual notions) transform, similar to all the <code>pre</code>, <code>post</code>, and <code>map</code> lemmas in the other files</li>
<li>the final three lemmas describing how colimits behave in <code>Type u</code>. (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>?)</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that I noticed while working on sheaves was that Lean couldn't figure out that if a category has limits then it also has products.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 13 2018 at 20:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135741730):
<p>I guess this means we need to add some instances.</p>

<p>Other stuff that should be done in other PRs later, and of which I have prototypes (but someone should feel free to do themselves):</p>
<ul>
<li>functors into a complete category are complete</li>
<li>all the gadgets getting between different shapes of limits (equalizers and products imply all limits, etc)</li>
<li>filtered limits, finite limits, finite products</li>
</ul>

<p>But maybe "limits implies products" should also be part of other PRs?</p>

<p>Yes, I've got it. It relies on <code>discrete_category.lean</code>, which I think never got PR'd yet.</p>

<p>I have a notational problem in the (co)limits PR. At first I'd introduced </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def sigma {C : Type u} [ùíû : category.{u v} C][has_coproducts.{u v} C] {Œ≤ : Type v} (f : Œ≤ ‚Üí C) : C

<p>but then realised <code>sigma</code> is a terrible idea, because it overloads the built-in sigma.</p>

<p>I thought to change <code>sigma</code> to <code>Sigma</code> and <code>pi</code> to <code>Pi</code>, but <code>Pi</code> is of course already taken for pi-types.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 14 2018 at 05:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135759879):
<p>Is <code>protected</code> the best solution?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 14 2018 at 05:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135759880):
<p>I'm a bit unclear on what happens when we use it.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 05:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135759882):
<p>it means you have to prefix the namespace</p>

<p>Hmm. I guess that's okay.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 05:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135759892):
<p>there are a few examples of things in the library named <code>sigma</code> and <code>pi</code> and protected</p>

<p>Ok, I'll try that.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 14 2018 at 05:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135759936):

<p>In other news, there's a second PR, containing the constructions limits =&gt; equalizers, limits =&gt; products, products + equalizer =&gt; limits, and functors into complete categories form a complete category, ready to go.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 05:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135760013):
<p>By the way, in response to an earlier suggestion of inferring has_products from has_limits or something like this, I suggest that all these be regular defs, and you make them instances in particular categories</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 05:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135760020):
<p>that way you get to decide which ones imply which others</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 14 2018 at 20:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135788644):

<p>Are there any examples of actual limits (in mathlib or in your repo)?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 14 2018 at 20:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135788825):
<p>so how close are we to direct limits?</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 14 2018 at 20:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135788830):

<p>This was my question: we have abstract notion of limits and colimits, but I think there is no example yet</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 14 2018 at 20:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135788884):
<p>Limits in Ring would be an example</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Oct 14 2018 at 20:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23416%20limits%20and%20colimits/near/135788999):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> maybe you could do one example, in order to demonstrate the interface, and then we could try to have another one.</p>

<p>I'm a bit indecisive about how to do rings. We can do it directly, or we can build machinery to do it quickly. :-)</p>

<p>What would be the machinery?</p>

<p>reflective subcategories (to get from Ring to CommRing) and monadic adjunctions (to get from Type to Ring)</p>

<p>But I don't know this stuff well; I'd need to talk to Reid again to get it all straight.</p>

<p>I guess that is an indication that doing things directly on the first pass is a good idea. :-)</p>

<p>Also, my PRs don't include filtered colimits yet, so the direct limits Kenny wants require another intermediate step.</p>

<p>I'd love to get this fancy stuff, but it would probably be better to first do it by hand for rings, and then check we get the same result using fancy stuff (I mean the same usability, hopefully the abstract result should be the same anyway)</p>

<p>As I mentioned in another thread, the perfect closure of F can be constructed as a direct limit of a bunch of copies of F.</p>

<p>No, I would like to do it (the general definition, that is). Next time I see Reid around I'm going to ask him about how to do it without too much duplication.</p>

<p>but then I see goals like <code>is_open ((Œª (a : ((s.to_shape).X).Œ±) (b : Œ≤), (s.œÄ b).val a) ‚Åª¬π' s_1)</code> which is pretty hard to read</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> You will see something very similar if you do products of rings. The <code>to_shape</code> and the <code>s.pi ..).val</code> etc are all parts of the category theory.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>, to parse that for you: <code>s_1</code> is presumably an open set. <code>s</code> is a cone (in this case called a "fan" because we're doing products, not general limits. It has a field <code>X</code>, which is the cone point. Unfortunately this is written as <code>(s.to_shape).X</code>; I wish the <code>to_shape</code> wasn't necessary; I'll investigate that further. I'd originally called <code>X</code> <code>cone_point</code>, but people's preference for brevity caused me to change it. In any case, <code>(s.to_shape).X</code> is now a <code>Top</code>, i.e. a bundled topological space. Then <code>((s.to_shape).X).Œ±</code> is the underlying type of points of that topological space. <code>s.œÄ b</code> is one of the projection maps of the cone, i.e. the continuous map from <code>((s.to_shape).X)</code> to <code>f b</code>. So the goal you reach is just saying: the preimage of an open set under the ... [oops, first attempt got this wrong]</p>

<p>At this point we're actually going to need to look at the topology we gave on <code>Œ† b</code>, and see that this is true pretty much by definition, using the fact that all the <code>(s.œÄ b).val</code> are continuous functions.</p>

<p>(assuming that's is the definition of the product topology we're using, I haven't looked)</p>

<p>If you have advice about renaming fields to make it easier to do that unpacking, please let me know!</p>

<p>I would suggest casing a whole bunch on <code>s</code></p>

<p>I would prefer to see a theorem that assumes a topological space and some properties</p>

<p>Another thing which doesn't work for me: duplication of duality.<br>
What about copying to_additive and adapting it to an duality method?</p>

<p>We talked about that in Orsay. I think Mario and Scott came to the conclusion that it is a lot of hassle.</p>
