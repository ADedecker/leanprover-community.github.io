<p>Oops, but Mario has very efficiently merged it in the meantime. :-)</p>

<p>Does that mean we need a new PR?</p>

<p>I've already made that PR, and it was merged immediately.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 02:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23397/near/135371793):
<p>whoa, what's up with that link in the title?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 02:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23397/near/135371796):

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I believe it's from the same automatic linkification that happens in messages</p>
