I just added some brief documentation for @**Simon Hudon**'s new hole command https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/397 for inserting stubs of structure definitions.

Oops, but Mario has very efficiently merged it in the meantime. :-)

Thanks for the doc, btw :)

I've already made that PR, and it was merged immediately.

whoa, what's up with that link in the title?

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 02:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23397/near/135371796):
did you do that or is that just the effect of linkification?

#### [ Scott Olson (Oct 08 2018 at 03:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23397/near/135373271):
@**Mario Carneiro** I believe it's from the same automatic linkification that happens in messages
