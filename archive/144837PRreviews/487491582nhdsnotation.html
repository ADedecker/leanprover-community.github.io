<p>It seems we need a discussion about this PR introducing a notation for the neighborhood filter of a point in a topological space. S√©bastien says he doesn't like this notation because it could make mathlib hard to understand for an outsider. This remark leaves me speechless, but probably I was a very stupid outsider when I started.</p>

<p>I didn't say "hard" but "even harder" :)</p>

<p>The question is about the notation for neighborhoods. The current notation is <code>nhds x</code> and Patrick proposes <code>ùìù x</code>. My point is that it is barely shorter, and a newcomer (knowing Lean but not this part of mathlib) could understand that <code>nhds x</code> is talking about neighborhoods of <code>x</code>, but not what <code>ùìù x</code> is. Patrick's point is that it is nicer and shorter. What do you think?</p>

<p>I also add that things like <code>A ‚Üí‚Çê[R] B</code> are much harder to parse for an outsider. But this is all a virtual debate. Outsider don't use filters, so they don't use the neighborhood filters, and they will have to relearn all of topology anyway.</p>

<p>In the perfectoid project we use the notation everywhere, and I've use it in every talk I ever displayed any Lean code.</p>

<p>In particular in calculations, having notation makes the calculation read as it does on paper.</p>

<p>This is just notation, which some people use, right? I don't know what all those &lt;&lt; things mean in the category theory library but I know that I can hover over them until they become stuff which I do know...</p>
