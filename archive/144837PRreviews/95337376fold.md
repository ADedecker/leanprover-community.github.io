#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 07 2018 at 20:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135361568):
@**Scott Morrison|110087** have you looked at the changes I've made to category theory? I'm splitting the functions and their laws into `has_hom` and `category`. Does this seem like a hard pill to swallow?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Oct 08 2018 at 02:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135371027):
I would have guessed a different split based on the names

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 02:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135371292):
You mean both the identity and composition staying with `category`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Reid Barton (Oct 08 2018 at 02:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135371420):
Yeah. I don't think we really have a math name for a "non-lawful" category, though.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 02:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135371620):
What if we went with: `has_hom`, `has_hom_id`, `semicategory` (this is for `has_hom` + associativity), and `category`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 02:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135372533):
What's the difference between a semicategory and a semigroupoid?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 02:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135372686):
nothing, afaict

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 02:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135372746):
Cool, that's good to know. @**Scott Morrison|110087** that sounds like a useful division. Would it be useful to make a class for composition as well?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 03:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135372918):
I think these subdivisions should be created need-based rather than just because we can. Is there a use for all these?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 03:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135373014):
The need for `has_hom` is so that `End` can have an identity and a composition when the `hom` doesn't have laws yet. That's useful so that `const (End _)` will be an applicative without laws when we don't know that we have a monoid without laws (`has_one` and `has_mul`)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 03:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135373073):
In this case for a monad (without laws) `m`, `a -> m a` can be considered an endomorphism and therefore a monoid without laws.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 03:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135373081):
Otherwise, we need `m` to be a lawful monad for `const (End ...)` to even have the operation of an applicative

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 05:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378268):
I guess the thing I'm not understanding is the need for all these "lawless" things. Why bother talking about them?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 05:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378296):
In a programming context you might want access to the operations without the proof obligations

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 05:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378325):
That's why `monad` and `lawful_monad` are separate

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 05:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378332):
Plus I know a few examples of things that are "almost" monads but are not lawful

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 06:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378548):
Hmm.. We should just use a meta version of sorry for the proof obligations in those cases!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 06:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378551):
In any case, I appreciate that lawless monads are in wide use.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 06:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378597):
So how about today we just create `has_hom`, and leave everything else on as as-needed basis.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 06:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378849):
It's true we could stub out the proofs, but I would really rather not make a habit of it. Better to promise nothing than to lie about a proof; you can exploit false proofs in the VM to obtain weird crashes and possibly memory unsafety in the future

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 08 2018 at 06:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135378865):
(I think stubbing out proofs of *true* things that you don't want to bother proving in a programming context is fine, though)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 09:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135384159):
@**Simon Hudon**, I'm happy with the split of `category` into `has_hom` and `category`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 08 2018 at 09:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135384436):
Is this #376?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 09:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135384486):
Yes.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 16:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135407315):
Nice indexing job @**Kenny Lau**

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 08 2018 at 16:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135407439):
Thanks @**Scott Morrison|110087** I'll keep it that way then. I'm a bit annoyed at the occurrences of `has_hom.hom` sprinkled here and there. How do you feel about just writing `hom` and making any other `hom` definition protected?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 08 2018 at 23:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135428255):
Hmm, not sure. Can you point to an annoying instance? The problem is that I wasn't expecting the user ever to write `hom`, because there's notation for it, so it seems awkward to claim the name.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 10 2018 at 22:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135565389):
Should the `example` directory of `category_theory` be renamed to `instances`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 10 2018 at 22:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135565479):
I agree; `example` makes it sound like ancillary stuff or the lean `example` keyword

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Oct 10 2018 at 22:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/135565868):
Cool, I'll do that in the fold PR, how about that?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Simon Hudon (Dec 27 2018 at 21:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23376%20fold/near/152618394):
@**Mario Carneiro** I think this is ready to be merged. The travis build fails but I believe that if you clear the cache, it will be ok. I renamed the `example` directory to `instances` and old files are lingering around.
