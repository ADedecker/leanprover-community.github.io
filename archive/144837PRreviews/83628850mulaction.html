<p>I'm having some issues with this PR. In the file <code>algebra/pi_instances.lean</code> there seems to be an issue with the <code>pi.module</code> instance. Lean is no longer happy with <code>{..pi.semimodule _}</code> as proof term. I don't really understand how these issues arise from making <code>semimodule</code> extend <code>mul_action</code>.<br>
If someone with more Lean-fu than me wants to take a look, I would be very grateful.</p>
