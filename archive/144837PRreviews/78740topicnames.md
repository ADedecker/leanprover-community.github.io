#### [Johan Commelin (Oct 07 2018 at 13:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135349506):
Can we have slightly more descriptive topic names please? Currently they are just hash-number, and they actually link to issues of the `lean` repo instead of `mathlib`...

#### [Scott Olson (Oct 07 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135349565):
An organization admin could modify the linkification filter for topic names to point those to mathlib, or make `lean#123` and `mathlib#123` work as topic names with auto-linking

testing: #123, lean#123

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350065):
Nice!

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350070):
Is there an easy way to link to PRs, since we use them more than issues anyway?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350074):
PRs and issues are in the same namespace (numberspace)

#### [Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350114):
you will notice that issue #123 I linked to is actually a PR

#### [Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 14:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350333):
Great.

#### [Scott Olson (Oct 07 2018 at 14:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR reviews/topic/topic names/near/135350692):
The topic named `#397` still has the wrong link but I suspect it would update if renamed and then renamed back
