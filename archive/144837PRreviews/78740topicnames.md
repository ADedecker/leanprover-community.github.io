#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 07 2018 at 13:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135349506):
<p>Can we have slightly more descriptive topic names please? Currently they are just hash-number, and they actually link to issues of the <code>lean</code> repo instead of <code>mathlib</code>...</p>

#### [ Scott Olson (Oct 07 2018 at 13:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135349565):
<p>An organization admin could modify the linkification filter for topic names to point those to mathlib, or make <code>lean#123</code> and <code>mathlib#123</code> work as topic names with auto-linking</p>

<p>testing: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/123" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/123">#123</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/123" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/123">lean#123</a></p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350065):
<p>Nice!</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350070):
<p>Is there an easy way to link to PRs, since we use them more than issues anyway?</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350074):
<p>PRs and issues are in the same namespace (numberspace)</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 07 2018 at 13:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350114):
<p>you will notice that issue <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/123" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/123">#123</a> I linked to is actually a PR</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 07 2018 at 14:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350333):
<p>Great.</p>

#### [ Scott Olson (Oct 07 2018 at 14:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/topic%20names/near/135350692):
<p>The topic named <code>#397</code> still has the wrong link but I suspect it would update if renamed and then renamed back</p>
