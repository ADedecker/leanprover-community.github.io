<p>In this PR I see</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">instance</span> <span class="n">additive</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">additive</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">id</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now I'm a complete amateur, so I'dd like to learn. Does it matter for Lean whether the <code>[fintype α]</code> is left or right of the <code>:</code> in this statement?<br>
As in, is the current statement in any sense different from</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">instance</span> <span class="n">additive</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">fintype</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">additive</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">delta</span> <span class="n">additive</span><span class="bp">;</span> <span class="n">apply_instance</span>

<p>I'd say no</p>

<p>No, the location of the colon only affects the inside of the theorem, not the uses</p>

<p>so writing this would usually make it harder to write the proof, but in this case it's easy</p>
