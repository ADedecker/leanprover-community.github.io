In this PR I see
```lean
instance additive.fintype : Π [fintype α], fintype (additive α) := id
```
Now I'm a complete amateur, so I'dd like to learn. Does it matter for Lean whether the `[fintype α]` is left or right of the `:` in this statement?
As in, is the current statement in any sense different from
```lean
instance additive.fintype [fintype α] : fintype (additive α) := by delta additive; apply_instance
```

I'd say no

No, the location of the colon only affects the inside of the theorem, not the uses

so writing this would usually make it harder to write the proof, but in this case it's easy
