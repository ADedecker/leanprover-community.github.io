<p>I am currently submitting my work on manifolds to mathlib. The first PR is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1359" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1359">#1359</a>, but other ones are coming along the way. The current final state of things can be seen in  <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/tree/manifold9" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/tree/manifold9">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/tree/manifold9</a>. In the summary of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1359" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1359">#1359</a>, I have added a list of what is coming next, but let me copy it here. Any comment or advice on design decisions or API is welcome in this stream.</p>
<p>Here is the summary of what is coming next:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/topology/local_homeomorph</code>: local homeomorphisms (just like local equivs, but with open source and target, and continuous functions between them).</li>
<li><code>geometry/manifold/fiber_bundle</code>: fiber bundles (where the fiber is a topological space, the base is a topological space, and local trivializations are formulated using local homeos). Useful to define the tangent bundle later on.</li>
<li><code>geometry/manifold/manifold</code>: define a manifold modelled on a general topological space (where the charts are given by local homeos). Define groupoids of local homeos, and specify what it means for a manifold to have this groupoid as structure groupoid.<br>
*<code>geometry/manifold/smooth_manifold_with_boundary</code>: as a particular case of manifolds, define smooth manifolds with boundary, where the model space is a normed vector space (or a nice subset of such a vector space, for instance a half space), where the coordinate changes are smooth.<br>
*<code>geometry/manifold/basic_smooth_bundle</code>: define a specific kind of smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold (the bundle should be trivial in the charts of the manifold), and use this machinery to define the tangent bundle (applications to differential forms or riemannian metrics should be easy, but are not done yet), as a smooth manifold.<br>
*<code>geometry/manifold/mderiv.lean</code>: the differential of a map between manifolds, as a map between tangent spaces. Follows the API for derivatives (and is defeq to the standard derivative when the manifold is a vector space, as it should be -- to get this was an important guidance in the choice of definitions).</li>
</ul>
