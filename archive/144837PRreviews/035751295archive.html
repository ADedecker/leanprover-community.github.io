<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1295" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1295">#1295</a> I added a folder where we can put one-off formalization projects. I called it <code>archive/</code>, following the archive of formal proofs. If this gets accepted, it would be nice to get <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> and/or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>'s formalization of IMO 2019-1, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span>'s formalization of the mutilated checkerboard. And of course for all other projects which I don't know on the top of my head.</p>

<p>We can probably add more information to the README, but we should first make some organizational decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want to have a size limit? I would say we shouldn't put the perfectoid space project in here. I'm also don't think we want to have things like Flypitch in here (but maybe some of the basic logic files are fine?). Something with the size of the cap set problem (2k-3k LOC) should be fine though (although presumably <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> wants that in its own repository)</li>
<li>We might want to specifically say that we don't want anything that is under active development?</li>
</ul>
<p>What else should be added to the README?</p>

<p>Can we also have a requirement that all general use lemmas have already been factored into <code>src/</code>? We really don't want this to be a "shortcut", that results in people not putting in the effort to polish up generally useful material for wide consumption.</p>

<p>Yes, I added that to the README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a pull request, do make sure that you put all lemmas which should be in mathlib in the right place (in mathlib).</p>

<p>Now reformulated to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a pull request, do make sure that you put all lemmas which are generally useful in right place in mathlib (in the <code>src/</code> directory).</p>
</blockquote>
