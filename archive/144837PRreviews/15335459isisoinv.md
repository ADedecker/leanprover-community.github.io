@**Scott Morrison|110087** I PRed a small change to `is_iso` to make the simp lemmas there a bit more usable in my opinion.

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 14:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146796514):
Also Mario merged it before I finished writing the above message.

I don't really undestand what this achieved? Surely `inv` meant the right thing all along?

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 19:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146815631):
Not good enough for simp, though

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 19:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146815707):
that's why I had to use `erw` [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/limits-others-new/category_theory/limits/limits.lean#L150) for example

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 19:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146815729):
after the change, I can use `rw` instead

#### [Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 20:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146816220):
argh, I really don't understand. :-(

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 20:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146816480):
oh

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 20:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23459%20is_iso.inv/near/146816492):
There are two things: `category_theory.inv` and `category_theory.is_iso.inv` (the field of the structure)
