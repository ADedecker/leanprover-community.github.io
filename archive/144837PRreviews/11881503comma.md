@**Reid Barton** You say that a bunch of this stuff is already in another PR. I lost track of which one. Is it already merged?

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863080):
Yes

Aah, now I see. Sorry, I missed that.

Ok, I'll merge this stuff into that file.

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863292):
I agree that we could be more consistent about sing/plurals. We have `isomorphism.lean` and `products.lean`... etc...

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863359):
Ok, I pushed a fix

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863424):
I would prefer if everything was singular, I think

though I think mathlib in general isn't consistent here either

#### [Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863489):
We'll wait till we get nice refactoring tools. I think there are plans for those in :four_leaf_clover:
