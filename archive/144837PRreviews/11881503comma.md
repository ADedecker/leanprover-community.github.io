<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> You say that a bunch of this stuff is already in another PR. I lost track of which one. Is it already merged?</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863080):
<p>Yes</p>

<p>Aah, now I see. Sorry, I missed that.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863135):
<p>Ok, I'll merge this stuff into that file.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863292):
<p>I agree that we could be more consistent about sing/plurals. We have <code>isomorphism.lean</code> and <code>products.lean</code>... etc...</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863359):
<p>Ok, I pushed a fix</p>

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 30 2018 at 15:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23503%20comma/near/148863424):
<p>I would prefer if everything was singular, I think</p>

<p>though I think mathlib in general isn't consistent here either</p>

<p>We'll wait till we get nice refactoring tools. I think there are plans for those in <span class="emoji emoji-1f340" title="four leaf clover">:four_leaf_clover:</span></p>
