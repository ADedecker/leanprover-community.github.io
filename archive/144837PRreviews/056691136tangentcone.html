<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1136" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1136">#1136</a>, on further properties of the tangent cone, is not really interesting per se. However, there is a lot of material I would like to submit (on an extended derivatives API, and the mean value inequality, and <code>C^\infty</code> functions) that depends on it. That is the problem with small PRs for which the interest is not obvious by itself. Anyway, I would be grateful if someone could have a look.</p>
