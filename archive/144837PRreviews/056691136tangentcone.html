<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1136" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1136">#1136</a>, on further properties of the tangent cone, is not really interesting per se. However, there is a lot of material I would like to submit (on an extended derivatives API, and the mean value inequality, and <code>C^\infty</code> functions) that depends on it. That is the problem with small PRs for which the interest is not obvious by itself. Anyway, I would be grateful if someone could have a look.</p>

<p>I think the issue is nobody has any opinion about this. I guess this story is mostly ignored in the real world. The PR looks good to me, but I never thought about the maths. Do you have any paper reference you could mention in the Lean file?</p>

<p>I would say that if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> has no opinion either then we should merge this</p>
