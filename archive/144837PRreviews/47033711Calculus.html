<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130500">@Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir</span> It's cool to see that people are working on Calculus!<br>
Experience has shown that it works best if you make lots of small PRs (&lt;200 lines). So I think you have more than enough for two or three meaningful PRs. Big mega-project PRs tend to rot away in the PR list.</p>

<p>Thank you for working on this. I'm not opposed to doing dimension one first. We will need specific statements for this case anyway, for teaching purposes, and because they have special notations. It would be a nice exercise to check that all proofs can be replaced by one-liners once we'll get the higher dimensional case. But I agree you should split this PR. You should also have a look at what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span>  did in order to handle punctured neighborhoods.</p>

<p>What should I have in my first calculus PR? Just the definitions of the derivative, or definitions with a few basic theorems? I'm not completely sure of how small PRs can be, especially when it comes to defining a whole new library.</p>

<p>Yes -- "wlog epsilon &lt; A" is another one (or even just epsilon &lt; 1 will be useful wherever powers are involved). And some of my <code>abs</code> splitting, which I did based on intuition, can be done easily (and in a way that generalises) with the triangle inequality.</p>

<p>Do you have a link? Is this in mathlib?</p>
