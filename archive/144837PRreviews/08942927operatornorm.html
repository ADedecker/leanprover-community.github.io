<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> Could you have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927">#927</a>? It looks great to me, and it is a prerequisite for a refactor of <code>fderiv</code> in terms of bounded linear maps that Jean Lo is planning, and that will play an important role for all the manifold stuff I am aiming for (especially for higher smoothness).</p>

<p>Sure thing. Today is really hectic, but I promise, I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Thanks for the review. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> would you like to put together the summary for the review thread on github? You probably have better insights about what working with the bundled maps would be like in practice, as well as the coercion/rewrite issue.</p>
<p>Also, do we know what's happening with the tests? The branch compiles on my system, so I think the Lean code is probably okay, but appveyor/travis are complaining about install scripts again.</p>

<p>Added a summary on the PR page.</p>

<p>Now that this is merged, here's a small report on the status of the <code>deriv</code> refactor. It's being done on a branched called <code>refactor-deriv</code>, and the current state of the relevant file can be found here:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean</a></p>
<p>Most of it is really straightforward edits changing assumptions and just swapping out the corresponding terms in the proofs. Nearly all of the results have been restated &amp; proven using bundled maps now. The only thing that I haven't been able to make work was the proof for the uniqueness of the derivative, in which I ran into some trouble with <code>simpa</code>. Unfortunately, I don't expect to be able to return to this in quite a while.</p>
