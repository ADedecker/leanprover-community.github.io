#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 23 2019 at 16:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23619%20adjunctions%3A%20defs/near/156697556):
<p>I just opened <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/619" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/619">#619</a>: this PR defines adjunctions between two functors. I intend to follow-up with two other PRs; one with basic properties; the other with some examples.</p>
