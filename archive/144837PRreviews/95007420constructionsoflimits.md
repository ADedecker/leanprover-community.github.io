Is `simp` slower or is `obviously` slower?

And do you care at all? @**Scott Morrison|110087**

it's `obviously` slower

I'm pretty sure that your compile time optimization goals are in direct opposition with Scott's goals

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794113):
which is why he was so sad to read your `faster` branch

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794160):
`obviously` calls everything else, including `simp`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Oct 14 2018 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794176):
well I'm also sad to read this PR.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794323):
I think that's fair. @**Scott Morrison** is there a reason you have decided to use `obviously` directly instead of the script that it generates?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 15 2018 at 00:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135796411):
So that I don't have to do any copying and pasting? :-)

So that the compile time of mathlib grows so large that more effort is put into tactic caching? :-)

I've already ripped out a huge number of `obviously` in these two PRs. All the sequences of `rw` are actually generated automatically by `rewrite_search` in my still-private version of `obviously`.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Oct 15 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135796477):
I can rip out more, of course ...
