<p>Is <code>simp</code> slower or is <code>obviously</code> slower?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 14 2018 at 23:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135793798):
<p>And do you care at all? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span></p>

<p>it's <code>obviously</code> slower</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794107):
<p>I'm pretty sure that your compile time optimization goals are in direct opposition with Scott's goals</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794113):
<p>which is why he was so sad to read your <code>faster</code> branch</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794160):
<p><code>obviously</code> calls everything else, including <code>simp</code></p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Oct 14 2018 at 23:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794176):
<p>well I'm also sad to read this PR.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Oct 14 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135794323):
<p>I think that's fair. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> is there a reason you have decided to use <code>obviously</code> directly instead of the script that it generates?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 15 2018 at 00:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135796411):
<p>So that I don't have to do any copying and pasting? :-)</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 15 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135796427):
<p>So that the compile time of mathlib grows so large that more effort is put into tactic caching? :-)</p>

<p>I've already ripped out a huge number of <code>obviously</code> in these two PRs. All the sequences of <code>rw</code> are actually generated automatically by <code>rewrite_search</code> in my still-private version of <code>obviously</code>.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Oct 15 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23420%20constructions%20of%20limits/near/135796477):
<p>I can rip out more, of course ...</p>
