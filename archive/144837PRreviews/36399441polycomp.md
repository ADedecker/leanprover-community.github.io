<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> Looks good to me. Is it correct that <code>evalâ‚‚_sum</code> and <code>eval_sum</code> are only helper lemmas? They are falling back to the implementation of polynomials, right?</p>

<p>Is there some motivation for <code>poly_comp</code>; I mean, just curious: is this part of some bigger project?</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 25 2018 at 08:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23441%20poly_comp/near/136459578):
<p>They are falling back to the implementation, but I think <code>finsupp.sum</code> comes up quite a lot, so unfortunately can't really be considered "primitive", which is annoying, because it is difficult to prove things using it.</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 25 2018 at 08:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23441%20poly_comp/near/136459589):
<p>No particular motivation, but I observed it was missing, and it's bound to be useful.</p>

<p>Might this be a reason to mark them <code>protected</code>? As a hint to the user that they aren't supposed to use these helper lemmas?</p>

<p>Aah, I was just hoping that you were doing something like power series <span class="emoji emoji-1f606" title="lol">:lol:</span></p>

<p>Also, should we have the same thing for <code>mv_polynomial</code>?</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Oct 25 2018 at 09:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23441%20poly_comp/near/136459922):
<p>Probably we should have it for <code>mv_polynomial</code>. Somebody's going to have to make a decision about whether to use the <code>with_bot</code> definition of <code>degree</code> for <code>mv_polynomial</code>, for consistency with <code>polynomial</code></p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Oct 25 2018 at 09:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23441%20poly_comp/near/136460127):
<p>I think we should. Of course <code>with_bot</code> wasn't around when <code>mv_polynomial</code> was written...</p>
