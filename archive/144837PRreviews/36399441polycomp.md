@**Chris Hughes** Looks good to me. Is it correct that `evalâ‚‚_sum` and `eval_sum` are only helper lemmas? They are falling back to the implementation of polynomials, right?

Is there some motivation for `poly_comp`; I mean, just curious: is this part of some bigger project?

They are falling back to the implementation, but I think `finsupp.sum` comes up quite a lot, so unfortunately can't really be considered "primitive", which is annoying, because it is difficult to prove things using it.

No particular motivation, but I observed it was missing, and it's bound to be useful.

Might this be a reason to mark them `protected`? As a hint to the user that they aren't supposed to use these helper lemmas?

Aah, I was just hoping that you were doing something like power series :lol:

Also, should we have the same thing for `mv_polynomial`?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Chris Hughes (Oct 25 2018 at 09:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23441%20poly_comp/near/136459922):
Probably we should have it for `mv_polynomial`. Somebody's going to have to make a decision about whether to use the `with_bot` definition of `degree` for `mv_polynomial`, for consistency with `polynomial`

I think we should. Of course `with_bot` wasn't around when `mv_polynomial` was written...
