<p>Ok someone approved this PR... now whose turn is it to merge it?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 01 2019 at 23:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392145):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> how does the new PR review system work?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 01 2019 at 23:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392479):
<p>If <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> is assigned to it and that he approves, he can merge it. If he's not sure about anything, he can invite someone else to review (not necessarily maintainers).</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Feb 01 2019 at 23:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392572):
<p>Okay, I'll merge it. I wasn't sure how the PR system works either.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 01 2019 at 23:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392683):
<p>No trouble! Maybe I should work out some documentation</p>

#### [ Johannes HÃ¶lzl (Feb 01 2019 at 23:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392734):
<p>I guess we still need to figure out how we want to handle it in the end. But small PRs like <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/666" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/666">#666</a> should be no problem. For bigger ones it is good to wait a while until everybody had the time to see it and comment</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 01 2019 at 23:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157392925):
<p>I must say that I don't really like this "timeout" approach. I'd rather we invite people to comment (as reviewers or assignees) and get them to say "I don't mind" or "I like it" instead of assuming that people with pertinent expertise agree if they don't say anything</p>

<p>If the most relevant person has already approved, is it reasonable to assign a PR to one of the mainainers? Or is it better to leave it as is?</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 02 2019 at 03:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157402308):
<p>I don't think you'll be able to make the assignment but bringing it to the attention of a maintainer should let them either make the assignment or merge</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 02 2019 at 03:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157402347):
<p>Are you talking about <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/673" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/673">#673</a>?</p>

#### [ Chris Hughes (Feb 02 2019 at 03:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157402415):
<p>Kenny's been assigning me to all his PRs.</p>

#### [ Simon Hudon (Feb 02 2019 at 03:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157402450):
<p>As a reviewer or an assignee?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Feb 02 2019 at 03:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157402900):
<p>As an assignee</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Feb 02 2019 at 03:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR%20reviews/topic/%23666%20div_zero/near/157403353):
<p>Yes, it seems I can assign, too. I've been requesting reviews, however, as that seems politer. :-)</p>
