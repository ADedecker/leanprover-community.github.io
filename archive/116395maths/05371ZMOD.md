Would anyone know what would be a short way to prove 449 ≡ -1 [ZMOD 5]?

```lean
theorem test : 449 ≡ -1 [ZMOD 5] := dec_trivial
```

`dec_trivial` might work, but if it takes too long you can rewrite it to equality of `449 % 5 = (-1) % 5` and prove `by norm_num`

It doesn't work for me, probably because I didn't reimport mathlib recently

Ok thanks I 'll try that

it isn't like you don't need mathlib to normnum

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Guy Leroy (Aug 01 2018 at 12:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/ZMOD/near/130706016):
I meant for dec_trivial

I don't think zmod decidability has changed recently

```lean
theorem test : 449 ≡ -1 [ZMOD 5] :=
by unfold int.modeq; norm_num
```

That works, thanks guys

I think you can even write `by norm_num [int.modeq]`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Guy Leroy (Aug 01 2018 at 13:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/ZMOD/near/130706170):
Yes indeed, even more concise
