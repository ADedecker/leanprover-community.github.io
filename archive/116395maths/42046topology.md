<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span>, I was wondering whether you either have proved or were planning to prove Urysohn'slemma or the Tietze extension theorem.<br>
I ask because I have an ugly, but working proof of the former lying around somewhere, and part of a proof of the latter, and it looks like your PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/464" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/464">#464</a> is the main thing I would need to finish it off.</p>

<p>No, I have not done it, and I don't plan to do it. You can go ahead if you want!</p>
