Hi @**Sebastien Gouezel**, I was wondering whether you either have proved or were planning to prove Urysohn'slemma or the Tietze extension theorem.
I ask because I have an ugly, but working proof of the former lying around somewhere, and part of a proof of the latter, and it looks like your PR #464 is the main thing I would need to finish it off.

No, I have not done it, and I don't plan to do it. You can go ahead if you want!
