<p>I am organising a Lean workshop in Freiburg (Germany), 13â€“17 July 2020.<br>
Some of you may have heard of the plans already during the Lean Together meeting in Pittsburgh. I've finally got the organisational hiccups worked out. So, if you are a mathematician, or you know a mathematician who is really interested in learning more about Lean, please let them know about this meeting: <a href="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/" target="_blank" title="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/">https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/</a></p>
<p>The plan is to have a couple of talks and tutorial sessions, but to also have ~50% of the time dedicated to hackathons and brainstorming sessions, or pair programming. Novices could team up with experts, to see how they go about setting up a theory, etc...</p>
<p>There is limited funding for PhD students and postdocs. Please let me know if you need this.<br>
In general, if you have any questions, please ask.</p>
