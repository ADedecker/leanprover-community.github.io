<p>Lol, I'm quite sure that the definition of <code>coverage</code> is wrong. I should demand that the collection of covers contains the singletons <code>{id : U ‚ü∂ U}</code> for every <code>U : X</code>.</p>

<p>If I'm right, this is also missing on nLab.</p>

<p>I retract this. There is a comment on nLab pointing out that you don't need to demand that identity morphisms cover. It doesn't change your category of sheaves.</p>

<p>This is one of the ugliest proofs I've written in a long time.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 20:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147545468):
<p>Also, I would like to get some feedback on the definition of the <code>covers</code> for <code>opens X</code>. This is the actual data that goes into a <code>site</code>. The rest doesn't matter, because it's only proofs. (They should of course be faster then what I have now.)<br>
Basically, there are at least three (equivalent) ways to specify the data of <code>covers</code>:<br>
1) <code>covers := Œª U Us, U.val = ‚®Üu‚ààUs, (u:over _).left.val</code> ‚Äî take the union in <code>set X</code><br>
2) <code>covers := Œª U Us, U = ‚®Üu‚ààUs, (u:over _).left</code> ‚Äî take the "union" in <code>opens X</code><br>
3) <code>covers := Œª U Us, U = limits.sigma (Œª u‚ààUs, (u:over _))</code> ‚Äî take the "union" as a colimit in the category <code>over U</code><br>
Do people already see reasons to choose/discard one of these options?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 12 2018 at 20:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sheaves%20and%20sites/near/147545537):
<p>I currently have option (2). But maybe option (3) is actually better, even though it is high-brow; because it would tie in better to all the facts that we (will) have about functors/limits/etc...</p>

<p>I wonder whether using actual families (instead of <code>set</code> everywhere) would make your life easier</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> Would you mind testing your most powerful version of <code>obviously</code> on (parts) of the proofs at the bottom of <code>sheaf.lean</code>?

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> , we should combine/adapt the stuff I wrote on bundled presheaves at some point, with a category structure based on:</p>

<p>Hmmm, I just realised that I don't even know what it means to be a sheaf with values in <code>C</code> when working on an arbitrary site.<br>
I can make sense of it</p>
<ul>
<li>if the site has pullbacks, or</li>
<li>if <code>C</code> is <em>concrete</em> in the sense that it comes with a forgetful functor to <code>Type</code>.</li>

<p>Sure. Say you have a set of objects C, and a function f : C \to Set. Make a new category with objects (X, Y), where Y is in f(X), and whose morphisms (X, Y) to (X', Y') are just the C-morphisms from X to X'.</p>

<p>then step 2 would be to check continuity, possibly you can use <code>continuous_subtype_nhds_cover</code> for this</p>

<p>You need <code>choice</code> to go from "for each x there exists a y such that ..." to a function mapping x to the corresponding y, even if you know that the corresponding y is also unique. So in that sense it's not exactly analogous to the axiom of choice in ZFC</p>

<p>The annoying thing is the pair <code>c, hc</code>. I would much rather work with <code>hc : has_colimit K</code> and <code>c : colimit K</code>. Because then I can use facts about how this colimit is defined. Of course I can build a unique isomorphism between the <code>c</code> that I got from Lean and the one that I'm interested in. But I wonder if it would make sense to change the setup a bit...</p>

<p>I think we can just add a lemma for that.<br>
You're saying you want to prove: if F : C -&gt; D and C already <code>has_colimits</code>, then to prove F preserves colimits it suffices to consider the ones provided by the <code>has_colimits</code> instance.</p>

Ramon is supposed to be completely refactoring the scheme project as part of his MSc thesis; I got him to look at locally ringed spaces but now these are done modulo the assertion that the category of rings has all colimits. Then Kenny mentioned Spec -- I think it would just be less nervy for us if we knew exactly what you guys were planning on doing and what Ramon can do (he has written thousands of lines of Coq code but is new to Lean). Currently we need that colimits exist in the category of commutative rings, and that the spectrum of a ring is a locally ringed space (which of course is a lot of work, even though it's in some sense done already). The first step towards this is that the spectrum of a ring has a presheaf of rings on the basis of open sets <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D(f)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.

<p>funny isn't it. For products and subobjects you feel like you've made progress. But colimits are quotients so it's always going to be a pain I think. I don't even really understand what the coproduct of an arbitrary set of rings looks like -- it seems to be some sort of direct limit of finite tensor products -- but of course we haven't built direct limits yet so there's a danger of going round in circles here.</p>

<p>There's something I can't get to add up here. Say there's a <code>has_colimits</code> instance and also a simpler <code>has_filtered_colimits</code> instance. Now let's say I'm trying to take a colimit and it happens to be filtered. If Lean uses the <code>has_colimits</code> instance then the colimit will be constructed in one way, but if Magic notices that the colimit is filtered then it could construct it using the simpler filtered colimit construction. The two constructions will give canonically isomorphic, but probably not defeq, objects, and doesn't this give rise to a diamond?</p>

<p>We want to rewrite <code>e : Œ± ‚âÉ Œ≤</code> in <code>{a : Œ± // p a}</code>, but what would be the goal? We get something like<code>{b : Œ≤ // p (f‚Åª¬π b)}</code>. But in many cases <code>p</code> itself is also parametric, i.e. we have actually <code>{b : Œ≤ // @p Œ± (f‚Åª¬π b)}</code> (not really, as <code>p</code> is describing a term and not a constant, but I hope you get the idea) Now when we can try to adopt the structure of <code>p</code> s.t. <code>Œ±</code> is completely replaced by <code>Œ≤</code>, and then <code>f</code> isn't occurring anymore</p>

<p>I've just had a quick look at that proof, Johan, and I don't seem to be able to make much improvement. :-( There does seem to be a small problem changing between <code>colimit</code> and <code>colim.obj</code>.</p>

<p>So here is what I imagine <code>derive rflsimp</code> (or whatever) should do: it looks at the current definition, and (as far as I thought this through, which is not that far) it does two checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>the definition is an "abbreviation" (like <code>def presheaf C := C \functor Type v</code>. In this case it looks up all the rflsimp lemmas that it derived for <code>C \functor D</code> and defines copies in the <code>presheaf</code> namespace.</li>
<li>the definition <code>X</code> is a structure. In this case it looks up all the fields. For a field <code>foo</code> it checks whether this is a Pi-type (?) and how many arguments the Pi takes. So if <code>foo := Œª a b c, bar(a,b,c)</code> then it will create the appropriate simp-lemma (proved by <code>rfl</code>) that</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course I don't know how to write <code>meta</code>-code. And of course this is probably a very simplified picture. But I think something like this should be possible, and I think it would result in three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>less boilerplate (especially in the category library!)</li>
<li>less broken proofs, where <code>tidy</code> doesn't work, because somewhere someone forgot to state the obvious <code>rfl</code>-simp-lemma.</li>
<li>less wasted time in hunting down the brokenness of the preceding point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nope, I couldn't work it out. The next "usual suspect" for simp not working is that the thing that needs to be <code>simp</code>ed is inside a function that looks superficially dependent but actually isn't when you think about it a bit. <code>simp</code>, which needs to build congruence lemmas to do "rewriting", can't work out what do to, but <code>rw</code> can.

To be precise: I have no trouble at all extending a presheaf from a basis to the whole space. The problem is checking that it sends sheaves to sheaves. The difficulty is probably due to the fact that I do not have a usable API around the sheaf condition.<br>
And I guess my sheaf condition is hard to work with right now because I'm trying to be quite general, doing sheaves on an arbitrary site.</p>

<p>Oh -- the proof involves some argument on stalks which for a general site is complicated? Are there universe issues or do you only work with small sites?</p>

<p>OK so I just spent 2 hours with Ramon going through this proof (sheaf on a basis extends to sheaf on site) again in the case of topological spaces. The ideas are all fresh in my mind at the minute so let me note them down in case there's anything helpful here.</p>
<p>Aah -- I now realise that actually I don't know how you're extending the presheaf at all. The way Ramon and I do it is that given a presheaf <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span></span></span></span> on a basis we can define the stalk <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F_x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.151392em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.13889em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">x</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">‚Äã</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> at a point <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> via a direct limit construction, and then we define a presheaf <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>F</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F^+</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.771331em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.771331em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.771331em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">+</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> on the space by saying that its values on an open <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span></span></span></span> are a subtype of a big Pi type sending <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>‚àà</mo><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x\in U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.72243em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit">x</span><span class="mrel">‚àà</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span></span></span></span> to an element of the stalk <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F_x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.151392em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.13889em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">x</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">‚Äã</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>; it's the subtype consisting of functions which are locally a section of the presheaf-on-a-basis.</p>

<p>The issue was that we didn't have the right API for this construction of extending a presheaf-on-a-basis to a presheaf on the space. A general presheaf on a space, when evaluated at some open <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span></span></span></span>, is just some random type. But for a presheaf coming from a presheaf-on-a-basis this is far from being true -- the sections are subtypes of pi types, and the restriction maps are literally restrictions. This is all wrapped up in the definition of the construction of a presheaf from a presheaf-on-a-basis.

<p>But we shouldn't have been doing this anyway. It seems to me that the correct thing to do is:</p>
<p>1) Define the construction <code>presheaf_on_basis_to_presheaf</code><br>
2) Define also the actual noncomputable function space, i.e. given <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span></span></span></span> a presheaf on a basis, and an open set $$U$ (not necc in the basis), define the space of functions sending an element <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span></span></span></span> to an element of the stalk <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F_x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.151392em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.13889em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">x</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">‚Äã</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and have some coercion from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>F</mi><mo>+</mo></msup><mo>(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F^+(U)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.771331em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1.021331em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.771331em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">+</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> to this space of functions.<br>

It's a theorem that the resulting function is independent of all choices. Define the noncomputable function and prove the theorem -- you will need it later!</p>
<p>We'd done none of this, and it was only when struggling through the proof that I began to understand what was missing. </p>
<p>I know you (Johan) are working in a far more complicated situation, but somehow these are the things which seem to me to be necessary to make things work smoothly. Ramon arrived in my office with a goal that had three <code>classical.indefinite_description</code>s on one side of an equality, and these are horrible to work with. The idea which Patrick showed so convincingly in his Nantes talk -- hide the nonconstructive stuff with a <code>choose</code> tactic and immediately go to the noncomputable function and the proof that it has the key property you want -- is a really important trick for getting things to run smoothly.</p>

<p>Yes, extending the presheaf is not too hard. What I'm missing is a good API for the sheaf condition.</p>

<p>What I learnt today was that there are special extra lemmas for presheaves which have come from a presheaf-on-a-basis, and those are what we needed to prove that sheaves go to sheaves.</p>

<p>Because it needs to work with abstract sites (where you don't know anything about the opens in your category) and then it should also work for concrete things like the open sets in a concrete topological space (and your presheaf has some concrete interpretation as functions)... somehow these two things don't play nicely together yet.</p>

<p>I would also like to see some code, I might be able to give some tips. I think you should define the glue construction  for functions, i.e. if you have a bunch of functions that agree on overlaps then you get a function on the union. You can put your choices here and never see them again</p>
