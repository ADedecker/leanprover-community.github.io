Some students here have developed the basic theory of free modules of finite rank over a ring (which later becomes a commutative ring and then a field). One issue I have with their work is that they are still using some placeholder notation for the fundamental construction of $$R^n$$, the free rank $$n$$ module over the ring $$R$$. What should the function which takes a ring `R` and a natural `n` and returns the `R`-module `R^n` be called? Any suggestions?

I guess there are two questions: name, and notation

For notation, assuming we can't use `R^n`, how about `R^âŠ•n`?

Why can't we use `R^n`? As for the name, how about `finite_free_module R n`?

Maybe we can use `R^n`, but in that case I assumed there was no choice to be made :)
