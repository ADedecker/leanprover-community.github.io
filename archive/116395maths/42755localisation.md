<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> Did you have a proof somewhere that if you localise a ring at <code>S</code>, then <code>S</code> maps to <code>units</code> of the localisation?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 23 2018 at 21:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248540):
<p>Or something similar to that?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 23 2018 at 21:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248548):

<p>Just to comment that the <code>@kbuzzard</code> in that PR had no visible effect (in the sense that I didn't notice anything). I've only just seen this PR now.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 23 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248724):
<p>Shouldn't that give you something in your GitHub notification area (or send you an email)?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 23 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248726):
<p>Yeah but now I switched GH notifications on I always have 100 notifications.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Nov 23 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248727):
<p>So now I just don't read them.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 23 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248852):
<p>Hmmm, maybe you should be more careful in which repositories you watch...</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 23 2018 at 21:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248895):
<p>Anyway, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> it's cool that this is coming to mathlib in some near future</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Nov 23 2018 at 21:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248897):
<p>...right</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 23 2018 at 21:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148249206):
<p><span class="emoji emoji-1f62e" title="open mouth">:open_mouth:</span> I also missed that PR!</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Nov 23 2018 at 21:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148249209):
