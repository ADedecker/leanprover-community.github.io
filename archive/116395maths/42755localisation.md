@**Kenny Lau** Did you have a proof somewhere that if you localise a ring at `S`, then `S` maps to `units` of the localisation?

Or something similar to that?

yes...

I don't think that is in mathlib.

 Just to comment that the `@kbuzzard` in that PR had no visible effect (in the sense that I didn't notice anything). I've only just seen this PR now.

Shouldn't that give you something in your GitHub notification area (or send you an email)?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Nov 23 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248726):
Yeah but now I switched GH notifications on I always have 100 notifications.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Nov 23 2018 at 21:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248727):
So now I just don't read them.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 23 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248852):
Hmmm, maybe you should be more careful in which repositories you watch...

Anyway, @**Kenny Lau** it's cool that this is coming to mathlib in some near future

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Nov 23 2018 at 21:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148248897):
...right

:open_mouth: I also missed that PR!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 23 2018 at 21:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/localisation/near/148249209):
