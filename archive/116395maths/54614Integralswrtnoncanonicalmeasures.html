<p>Currently the "main" integral in <code>measure_theory</code> is the integral (Lebesgue or Bochner) w.r.t. the canonical measure. There is a rudimentary interface for computing integrals w.r.t. non-canonical measures but it lags behind the "main" one, and one has to restate all theorems before using them.<br>
I know quite a few theorems dealing with non-canonical measures or even with the space of measures. The simplest example is the substitution rule; actually it says something about push forward of a measure. There are many more advanced examples in dynamical systems, especially in ergodic theory.<br>
I propose to refactor it so that all definitions/theorems take measure as an argument. It shouldn't be too hard to write <code>variables (m : measure α)</code> instead of <code>[measure_space α]</code>, then prefix each <code>apply</code> with <code>m.</code>. This way it will be easy to apply these theorems both to the canonical measure and non-canonical measures. E.g., we can leave current binder notation for integrals w.r.t. the canonical measure, and add some other notation for integrals w.r.t. any measure.<br>
Do I miss something?</p>

<p>I would like common / important theorems to be restated with the notation, but I think it would be a good idea to do the main development in this context.</p>
