<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> The next thing we discussed in Amsterdam was <code>def uniformity {α : Type*} [uniform_space α] : filter (α × α) :=
(@uniform_space.to_core α _).uniformity</code>. There are a lot of places where we see <code>@uniformity α _</code> but also a lot of place where <code>α</code> is indeed inferred. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> seemed to think we should make <code>α</code> an explicit argument in this definition. This is not an easy decision. Simply changing the argument type results in a <em>lot</em> or errors in <code>uniform_space.basic</code>. So I won't PR this change before discussing it more. My opinion is we should change it anyway, because I find many statements and goals confusing because it says <code>uniformity</code> without saying what is the base type. Of course there are intermediate options, like having two defs, but I fear this will lead to pain. I'm also in favor of having a local notation for this, as in my Amsterdam talk (I use mathcal U for the def with explicit α).</p>

<p>I'm fine with this change i think replacing <code>([^@])uniformity</code> with <code>\1(uniformity _)</code> should solve most errors.</p>
