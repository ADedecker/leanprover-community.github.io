<p>The following equality isn't <code>rfl</code>. I think it should be. I tried redefining the instances, because I thought it might have something to do with the issue that stopped <code>(0 : with_bot nat) = some 0</code> being definitional, but I couldn't get it to work </p>

<p>Hmmm, since when is <code>(0 : with_bot nat) = some 0</code> no longer defeq? I know that things like that worked for <code>with_zero</code> a couple of weeks ago. You are just using a wrapper around <code>option</code> and the obvious coercion. This seems a bit surprising.</p>

<p>Ages ago it didn't work, but it's now fixed.</p>
