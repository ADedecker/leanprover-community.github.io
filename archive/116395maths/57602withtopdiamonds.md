The following equality isn't `rfl`. I think it should be. I tried redefining the instances, because I thought it might have something to do with the issue that stopped `(0 : with_bot nat) = some 0` being definitional, but I couldn't get it to work 
```lean
example : @with_top.add_monoid â„• _ = add_comm_monoid.to_add_monoid _ := rfl
```

Hmmm, since when is `(0 : with_bot nat) = some 0` no longer defeq? I know that things like that worked for `with_zero` a couple of weeks ago. You are just using a wrapper around `option` and the obvious coercion. This seems a bit surprising.

Ages ago it didn't work, but it's now fixed.
