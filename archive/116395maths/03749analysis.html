<p>Hi there, I was wondering if we had a proof formalised in Lean yet that the limit of (sin(x))/x is equal to 1. I looked over Mathlib and couldn't find anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I don't think we have. We have very little "concrete" results so far.</p>

<p>I also think it might be quite a challenge given current technology. But you might be able to reuse a whole bunch of computations that Chris used for the definition of pi</p>

<p>This is basically equivalent to proving that the derivative of sin is cos, which in my mind is a key missing thing. What I think we really need is that a power series is differentiable within its radius of convergence.</p>

<p>At school I was told that we would at some point prove that sin(x)/x tended to 1 as x tended to zero. We then used that fact to deduce that the derivative of sin was cos, and then later on after we'd drawn the graph of sin and had got thoroughly used to the fact that its derivative at 0 was cos(0)=1, the teacher told us that it was now obvious that sin(x)/x tended to 1 because cos(0)=1.</p>

<p>I've never taught this stuff so the last time I saw a proof of it was 30 years ago and I have no idea where to start.</p>

<p>You're right that it looks like a nice general statement though. Is it proved in 2nd year analysis at Imperial?</p>

<p>I guess the road map is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Define power series, with ROC, etc</li>
<li>Define sine as some power series, prove that that power series converges (possibly before defining sine to be that power series) </li>
<li>Do a similar thing for cosine</li>
<li>Use the Fr√©chet derivative in mathlib to ge the univariate derivative.</li>
<li>Prove some result like what Chris has mentioned about being able to differentiate inside the power series within the ROC or something else about uniform convergence</li>
<li>Differentiate the sine power series, see that it is equal to the cosine power series</li>
<li>Try to generalise to the complex numbers (shouldn't be too difficult, just replace a bunch of symbols and then fix things)</li>
<li>Try to generalise even further to some sufficiently regular algebraic structure</li>
</ol>

<p>As in, we have a definition of formal power series in mathlib. But nothing yet about ROC</p>

<p>Also, Chris's work on <code>exp</code>, <code>sin</code> and <code>pi</code> was from before the definition of power series. So far these pieces of the library have not been glued together</p>

<p>Yes please do this. If people want to change it later that's fine. I am interested in formalising parts of our undergraduate syllabus and the fact that the derivative of sin is cos is used from day 1 in the "methods" courses (without justification, because everyone was told it in high school and the methods courses continue with this tradition) so this sort of thing is a big roadblock to even beginning to formalise the problem sheets in these courses.</p>
