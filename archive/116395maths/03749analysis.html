<p>Hi there, I was wondering if we had a proof formalised in Lean yet that the limit of (sin(x))/x is equal to 1. I looked over Mathlib and couldn't find anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I don't think we have. We have very little "concrete" results so far.</p>

<p>I also think it might be quite a challenge given current technology. But you might be able to reuse a whole bunch of computations that Chris used for the definition of pi</p>

<p>This is basically equivalent to proving that the derivative of sin is cos, which in my mind is a key missing thing. What I think we really need is that a power series is differentiable within its radius of convergence.</p>

<p>At school I was told that we would at some point prove that sin(x)/x tended to 1 as x tended to zero. We then used that fact to deduce that the derivative of sin was cos, and then later on after we'd drawn the graph of sin and had got thoroughly used to the fact that its derivative at 0 was cos(0)=1, the teacher told us that it was now obvious that sin(x)/x tended to 1 because cos(0)=1.</p>

<p>I think you actually want this more general result first. <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Derivative_of_Uniformly_Convergent_Series_of_Continuously_Differentiable_Functions" target="_blank" title="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Derivative_of_Uniformly_Convergent_Series_of_Continuously_Differentiable_Functions">https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Derivative_of_Uniformly_Convergent_Series_of_Continuously_Differentiable_Functions</a></p>

<p>I've never taught this stuff so the last time I saw a proof of it was 30 years ago and I have no idea where to start.</p>

<p>You're right that it looks like a nice general statement though. Is it proved in 2nd year analysis at Imperial?</p>

<p>I think there's something more general about sequences.</p>
