#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jul 17 2018 at 20:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%C2%AC%20%282%20%E2%88%A3%205%29/near/129828701):
Hello! I'm a professor of number theory and I'm having trouble proving that 2 does not divide 5. 

```lean
example : ¬ (2 ∣ 5) := sorry
```

I was expecting `dec_trivial` to work [EDIT : it works fine, I was just being an idiot]. I can do cases on the definition and then a painful case by case check but surely there's an easier way?

[NB for newer users -- that `∣` sign is not `|` but actually `\|`, I think to avoid confusion with set notation `{a : X | p a}` ]

PS @**Ellen Arlt** this is the last remaining case of your last lemma -- I just need to check that there are no 5-loops :-)

At least Lean knows what to do with a five lines proof which contains two name collisions.

Actually you don't need to know any lemma name @**Kevin Buzzard** :
```lean

Yes, that occurred to me (I wrote this Q and then closed my laptop and went for dinner). I guess the point is that `a \| b` should be decidable, but if it isn't there's still a chance that Johan's lemma is known and that `a % b = c` is decidable
