Johannes [just added UFD](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/commit/dd0c0aeefcaf6a438ab4273d7a1f42e1b8225847)!

Crazy stuff. Looks very different (and much better) than anything I would have written. Here are some random things one could do: PID -> UFD, a Noetherian ring is a UFD iff all height 1 primes are principal, a regular local ring is a UFD, Gauss' lemma about factoring in $$K[x]$$ ($$K$$ the field of fractions of $$R$$) being "the same" as factoring in $$R[x]$$, $$R$$ a UFD implies $$R[x]$$ a UFD.

Seeing all this lattice stuff reminds me that as far as we know we still don't have the [fourth isomorphism theorem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theorem_(group_theory)) for any of groups, abelian groups, additive groups, additive abelian groups, R-modules or rings.

Could you explain what looks different?

I wouldn't have used the word "lattice" at all :-)

they're multisets maybe?

I'll find out tomorrow. I need to sleep: kids go back to school tomorrow, so I go back to getting up early :(

You make a good point though -- this was definitely something which sprung out at me when I was looking throuhg it. I guess to get an overview of the PR one could look at the *definitions*. We have `associated` which presumably is the predicate which is true on a b if a = u b for u a unit. We have the standard definition of UFD, then `factor_set`, `factors'` and `factors` and then all that GCD domain stuff which I think is a CS thing

Hey -- if I use `leanpkg upgrade` to pull that update of `mathlib`, a dependency for the perfectoid project, into the perfectoid project, and then I type `leanpkg build` withing `_target/deps/mathlib`, will it take 10 seconds or 20 minutes to compile? Note that I already did this once, earlier today, and this is just one new file which nothing else depends on.

Depends on which commit you're at specifically, but I'd bet on a long build because the commit right before that one touched algebra.ring and data.multiset

@**Patrick Massot** my kids are back on Wed and sanity will once again prevail in our house. As for the `a ⊔ b + a ⊓ b = a + b` thing, I think what's going on is that `factorset alpha` is defined to be ` with_top (multiset { a : associates α // irreducible a }) `, so that is either a finite set of irreducible (up to units) or an artificial "top", which presumably corresponds to the factors of zero. `+` is union of multisets, so `{3,3,5}+{3,7}={3,3,3,5,7}`, and the meet and join are just infs and sups with multisets. The `with_top` is so that we can factor zero and still have a divides b iff factors of a are a subset of factors of b.

> I would have just done the maths stuff, not the weird CS stuff

You have such a funny idea of what CS is. I think you just think everything that isn't the math you do is CS

right :-)

I mean, you guys must have learnt it somewhere, and it's definitely not in a maths degree, so what is left? `gcd domain` -- ?!

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Sep 02 2018 at 23:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229065):
My eldest son is going to university next month to study computer science and philosophy, and there was a maths book which was recommended reading for his course so I got it out of our library for him to take a look at, and it really made me laugh -- "how to store a real number in 32 bits" etc :-)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johannes Hölzl (Sep 02 2018 at 23:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229207):
So I don't know much about UFDs itself, but the formalization of factors as multiset of associated elements felt very natural. Adding a top element was an easy thing, next step would be to show that the multisets form a conditionally complete lattice with bottom, then we get that `factor_set` is a complete lattice and we get GCD (infimum) and LCM (supremum) of arbitrary sets. `a ⊔ b + a ⊓ b = a + b` is the fact that `gcd a b * lcm a b = a * b` expressed as (extended) multiset of factors.

you surely can't take an LCM of an arbitrary set -- you mean an arbitrary finite set?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Sep 02 2018 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229222):
No, an arbitrary set. That's cool!

just to be clear then -- is the LCM of all the primes which are 1 mod 4 equal to zero?

That's CS nonsense :-)

It is a bit funny that with this interpretation 3 | 2^infty

Yes, all unbounded LCMs are zero

I have actually seen some version of this which is not what Johannes has used, and it's the order of a profinite group. A general order is $$\Pi_pp^{e_p}$$ with $$e_p$$ allowed to be all non-zero and even all infinity (indeed the order of the profinite completion of the integers is $$\Pi_pp^\infty$$)

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Sep 02 2018 at 23:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229363):
and with interpretation sanity prevails again and 3 does not divide $$2^\infty$$

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Sep 02 2018 at 23:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229368):
I guess the more mathematically natural approach just completes the multisets as functions Prime -> with_top nat

I think that's the same as what you suggest

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Sep 02 2018 at 23:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229374):
that would be for profinite orders

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Sep 02 2018 at 23:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133229413):
the far more mathematically natural way to do this UFD thing would just be to ignore zero rather than shoehorn it in

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Sep 03 2018 at 00:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133231295):
I suppose another way which would look more natural to a mathematician would be to embed the multisets into the partially ordered set of principal ideals. Then one can see what the natural lattice structure is -- you can embed the principal ideals into the lattice of all ideals. Here you see the "correct" GCD of X and Y in the polynomial ring K[X,Y] in two variables -- rather than the empty multiset it's the non principal ideal generated by X and Y. The notion of GCD in a UFD does not seem so useful to me -- you can't solve lX + mY = GCD in general,  for example. Still I can imagine you guys finding some sort of strange use for it...

.. maybe a Galois insertion or something...

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Sep 03 2018 at 06:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/UFD/near/133239791):
Right, I think what Kevin suggests would be very useful. Take gcd's as ideals, and you open up another realm of interesting theorems to be formalized...
