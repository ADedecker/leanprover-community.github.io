<p>Wasn't there someone in NL last summer formalising basics of class groups of number fields? They did invertible ideals, but didn't get as far as defining the class group. I've mentioned this to a couple of people but they didn't know about this. I am pretty sure this person even sent me an email with some stuff -- am currently trying to find it :-/</p>

<p>Antoine Bereau in an internship with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133635">@Sander Dahmen</span> , maybe? I don't really remember what Antoine was formalizing but that sounds familiar.</p>

<p>That makes it rather easier to find his email :-)</p>

<p>That's correct. His files are a bit old though. Actually <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238446">@Anne Baanen</span> is (also) reconsidering fractional ideals and we want to look at class groups (or Picard groups) soon.</p>
