### [(-1)^i](758631i.html)

Given `i : nat`, an additive commutative group `A`, and `a : A`, I want to talk about `(-1)^i a`. Is there already something in mathlib that does that? Or should I roll my own thing?
I guess I could take the `i`-th composite of `neg` with itself, and apply that to `a`. But is that the appropriate thing to do?

`add_group.gsmul ((-1) ^i) a` I think
