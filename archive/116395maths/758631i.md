<p>Given <code>i : nat</code>, an additive commutative group <code>A</code>, and <code>a : A</code>, I want to talk about <code>(-1)^i a</code>. Is there already something in mathlib that does that? Or should I roll my own thing?<br>
I guess I could take the <code>i</code>-th composite of <code>neg</code> with itself, and apply that to <code>a</code>. But is that the appropriate thing to do?</p>

<p><code>add_group.gsmul ((-1) ^i) a</code> I think</p>
