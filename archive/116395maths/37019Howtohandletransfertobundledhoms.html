<p>It's seems to have been decided that using bundled ring homs and group homs is going to be the mathlib style. Currently the library is not set up to make it easy for people to write new code using bundled homs, and it is quite a major refactor to update the library to do this. I think perhaps the bulk of the refactor has to be done in one go, as soon as the <code>ideal</code> file is updated, a bunch more stuff will have to be updated as well. Because of this I'm a little bit cautious about merging stuff that will make this refactor harder. </p>
<p>What's the best way of handling this? Should we refuse to merge anything that uses unbundled homs, or will a more gradual approach work?</p>

<p>Thanks for starting this discussion. I think people said that the refactor could be done slowly and gradually, even though the total effort would be more than when everything's done in one go.</p>

<p>I realize that the amount of unbundled stuff being added to the library might grow faster than the amount of parts in the library being refactored... so the process might never converge.</p>

<p>Giving bundled versions of the lemmas in the most used parts of the library might help the process converge faster. I'm thinking of ideals, subgroups, and maybe <code>polynomial.eval</code> and <code>map</code></p>

<p>I don't have a clue. I think I might have been at least partially to blame for the fact that we have both bundled and unbundled versions of some things, but I was just annoyed that everyone seemed to think that bundled was the way to go and yet unbundled was what we had.</p>
