<p>It's seems to have been decided that using bundled ring homs and group homs is going to be the mathlib style. Currently the library is not set up to make it easy for people to write new code using bundled homs, and it is quite a major refactor to update the library to do this. I think perhaps the bulk of the refactor has to be done in one go, as soon as the <code>ideal</code> file is updated, a bunch more stuff will have to be updated as well. Because of this I'm a little bit cautious about merging stuff that will make this refactor harder. </p>
<p>What's the best way of handling this? Should we refuse to merge anything that uses unbundled homs, or will a more gradual approach work?</p>
