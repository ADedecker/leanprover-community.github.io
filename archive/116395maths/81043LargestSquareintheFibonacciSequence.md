Did you know that 144 is the largest square in the Fibonacci sequence?

The proof is elementary but delicate

Mason-stother's polynomials are from us both, most parts were done by Jens, some by me. Its okay to only credit Jens.

Hi! How can I help best? Maybe start building Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2] ? I have a little experience with field extensions from abstract algebra this past semester ...

thatâs really just Z[sqrt(5)] right? field operations will get you (1+-sqrt(5))/2 from that

Right -- there is Q(sqrt(5)) = Q(alpha) [alpha := (1+sqrt(5))/2] and there is Z[sqrt(5)] which is strictly smaller than Z[alpha] [it has index 2]

The only reason I suggested the ring not the field was (1) rings have fewer axioms than fields and (2) my instinct was to construct the smallest object which was mathematically reasonable [so no semirings or distribs, thank you] and which contained enough to formalise the statement "u_m = (alpha^m - beta^m) / sqrt (5)"...oh crap

OK so @**Nicholas Scheel** if you want to take a look at how the complex numbers were built from the real numbers in mathlib (in some file called complex.lean probably) then you could just copy this and build Q(sqrt(5)) from Q by adjoining a square root of 5

The only difficulty will be in proving that if a+b*sqrt(5) is non-zero then a^2-5b^2 is non-zero, which you need for division

For the complexes the argument is that everything is positive, that doesn't work here

you need that 5 isn't the square of a rational

at some point one would need this anyway, to prove Z[alpha] is an integral domain, so there's no getting away from it

Ah okay, I see ... I think I'll try to build Z[alpha], doesn't look like we'll need division

@**Nicholas Scheel** I also made a bit of a start on univariate polys, although I haven't done much more than copy Johannes stuff on multivariate polys.

with `sup` you don't need to use `iget`. `max` is the better name but I think `sup` has the better behaviour.

I think there are good reasons to believe that gcd 0 0 = 0 is *right* over both nat and int, and in traditional math, if you think about the integers in that calculation as representing their principal ideals. (gcd m n) = (m, n)

I need to go and steer my children towards their beds now. Thanks for the help all of you. Mario and Kenny, I see the advantages of the "zero bigger than everything" approach here! Of course it's just the ideal-theoretic way of thinking about it -- gcd(x,y) = ideal generated by x and y, and if it's principal then let's choose a canonical generator if we can.

Note the last part -- point 12 is slightly delicate, it needs the following consequence of uniqueness of prime factorization: if gcd(x,y)=1 and x*y is a square then x and y are both squares (here x,y>0).

The theorem is that mod 16 it goes like this:

(because each term in that list is the sum of the previous two terms mod 16, and at the end we have 15 + 1 = 0 and 1 + 0 = 1 so we wrap back)

```quote
if t < 14 it's some lemma of the form `(a+b)%m = (a%m+b%m)%m` -- is that in Lean/mathlib?
```
int.modeq.modeq_add should help, since this is defeq to `a + b \== a%m + b % m` Although I forgot `modeq_mod` i.e. , so you'll have to prove that.
Why not just prove it as a lemma about integers mod n, and not naturals.

The problem with working with integers mod n is that if you want the _input_ to fib to be an integer mod n (n would be 24 here) then you have to prove that your definition is well-defined.

Yeah, that's the analogue of showing that if $$z=x+iy$$ is a complex number which isn't zero, then you can divide by $$z$$, by multiplying by $$\overline{z}$$ and then dividing by the non-zero real $$z\overline{z}$$.

So as Kenny says it's precisely the irrationality of $$\surd 5$$, or, more precisely, it's the statement that no rational number squared is $$5$$ (rather than any statement about real numbers not being rational)

So one way to do it is to prove that if $$a+b\surd 5$$ is non-zero then the rational $$a^2-5b^2$$ is non-zero and then use that a non-zero rational has an inverse.

I guess `z * z - z - 1 = (z - Î±) * (z - Î²)` is also a way to prove alpha*beta = -1

Theorem (reverse mathematics): you need to use induction to prove that L(n) = F(n) + F(n-3).
Proof: [link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28%CE%B1%5Ex%2B%CE%B2%5Ex%29-%28%28%CE%B1%5Ex-%CE%B2%5Ex%29%2B%28%CE%B1%5E%28x-3%29-%CE%B2%5E%28x-3%29%29%29%2Fsqrt%285%29%29+where+%CE%B1%3D%281%2Bsqrt%285%29%29%2F2%2C%CE%B2%3D%281-sqrt%285%29%29%2F2).

and if you define L(n) := F(n) + F(n-3), you would have to use induction to prove other things later
