<p>Right -- there is Q(sqrt(5)) = Q(alpha) [alpha := (1+sqrt(5))/2] and there is Z[sqrt(5)] which is strictly smaller than Z[alpha] [it has index 2]</p>

<p>The only reason I suggested the ring not the field was (1) rings have fewer axioms than fields and (2) my instinct was to construct the smallest object which was mathematically reasonable [so no semirings or distribs, thank you] and which contained enough to formalise the statement "u_m = (alpha^m - beta^m) / sqrt (5)"...oh crap</p>

<p>OK so <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111651">@Nicholas Scheel</span> if you want to take a look at how the complex numbers were built from the real numbers in mathlib (in some file called complex.lean probably) then you could just copy this and build Q(sqrt(5)) from Q by adjoining a square root of 5</p>

<p>The only difficulty will be in proving that if a+b*sqrt(5) is non-zero then a^2-5b^2 is non-zero, which you need for division</p>

<p>with <code>sup</code> you don't need to use <code>iget</code>. <code>max</code> is the better name but I think <code>sup</code> has the better behaviour.</p>

Of course it's just the ideal-theoretic way of thinking about it -- gcd(x,y) = ideal generated by x and y, and if it's principal then let's choose a canonical generator if we can.</p>

<p>and for that you need: n square iff v_p(n) even for all primes p (v_p(n) = largest power of p dividing n) and gcd(x,y)=1 iff min(v_p(x),v_p(y))=0 for all primes p</p>
