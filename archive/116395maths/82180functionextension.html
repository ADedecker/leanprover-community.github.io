<p>Currently we have a hack at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180</a> ensuring that we could potentially extend by contuity some functions with values in a space which is not regular. Is there any use to this? The trade-off is we need to assume the dense embedding of the original space into the space we want to extend to is injective. I don't know any case where we want to target to be non-regular whereas there is a clear use case for dropping the injectivity assumption: the completion of uniform spaces.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of this "feature", I see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> made me change that last summer, so it's probably safe to assume nothing will be impacted.</p>

<p>Which properties can you show if the dense embedding is not injective? How do you state universality (is this the right term?). Otherwise, I'm fine with changing it as long as the extensions like the Bochner integral works.</p>

<p>Johannes, I think I can prove almost everything without injectivity. I don't understand what universality you don't see how to state. I'm not worried about Bochner integration, I don't see any non-separated spaces could show up there</p>

<p>What would be a good name for a function from a topological space to another one with the property that it pulls back the target topology to the source topology? This is half of what <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L20-L21" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L20-L21">we ask</a> of a topological embedding. The other half is injectivity which is actually completely irrelevant in almost every lemma we prove about topological embedding. So I think we should really have a name for the crucial part.</p>

<p>Another issue with the definition I linked to is it is stated as an <code>and</code> instead of a structure with two fields. And then we have <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L81-L82" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L81-L82">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L81-L82</a> which first complains it doesn't use the previous definition, and then is defined as a structure with three fields. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> how would you feel if we had a web of structures extending each other here? The bases would be structures with only one axiom, either the induced topology axiom or a density axiom, then structures combining them, with variants adding an injectivity assumption or not. And then variations with uniform structures. Note that I don't suggest making any of these classes, only structures in Prop. One thing that I like with this approach is that proofs can use fields names instead of anonymous <code>and</code> constructors, and using the various parts also goes through meaningful names like <code>hf.inj</code> instead of <code>hf.1</code>. The down-side is you get a bunch of <code>hf.to_something.some_property</code>, unless we restated <code>some_property</code> for every extending structure. Or should we use flat (aka "old") structures?</p>
