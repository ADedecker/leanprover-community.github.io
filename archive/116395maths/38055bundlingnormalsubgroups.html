<p>Should normal subgroups be bundled? I am a bit confused about this.</p>
<p>Subsets of a group G are bundled -- they're <code>set G</code>. The general concensus amongst the community is that subgroups of G should also be bundled -- they can be <code>subgroup G</code>. There's a local project at Imperial with bundled subgroups and they're working fine.</p>
<p>But we're venturing into quotients so we need the notion of a normal subgroup. If we also bundle these as <code>normal_subgroup' G</code> then we have the issue that a normal subgroup of G is now not a subgroup. We can put a coercion to subgroups, but then there's sometimes a coercion from subgroups to subsets, and we are ending up with double coercions and things just don't look good.</p>
<p>Thinking about how to solve this made me realise that I don't really understand what's going on. Are we bundling subgroups because they just seem to work better? Is the idea that we bundled submodules and they worked really well? Is there an argument for making normal subgroups a typeclass on subgroups? This feels similar to making subgroups a typeclass on subsets  -- which is what the community decided to move away from. What are the disadvantages of letting normal subgroups be a typeclass on bundled subgroups?</p>
