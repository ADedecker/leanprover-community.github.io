<p>I have put almost all of my Lean files at <a href="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master</a>.  There are about 19000 lines by the crudest metric, although I am sure that someone more skilful could achieve the same results with much less space.  There is a README outlining what is there, and many files have substantial header comments.  I would be interested in moving some of it to mathlib, although that will probably take a large amount of work with refactoring, complying with coding conventions and so on.  I would be interested in comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>Which of the homotopy stuff do you think is appropriate for mathlib? Do you know about what Reid Barton has been doing with homotopy theory? (I don't but there's a repo somewhere)</p>
