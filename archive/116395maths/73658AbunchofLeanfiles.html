<p>I have put almost all of my Lean files at <a href="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_lib/tree/master</a>.  There are about 19000 lines by the crudest metric, although I am sure that someone more skilful could achieve the same results with much less space.  There is a README outlining what is there, and many files have substantial header comments.  I would be interested in moving some of it to mathlib, although that will probably take a large amount of work with refactoring, complying with coding conventions and so on.  I would be interested in comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>Which of the homotopy stuff do you think is appropriate for mathlib? Do you know about what Reid Barton has been doing with homotopy theory? (I don't but there's a repo somewhere)</p>

<p>The file <code>itloc.lean</code> is rather specialised, but <code>poset.lean</code>, <code>subdiv.lean</code> and <code>upper.lean</code> could certainly move into mathlib,  possibly after some reorganisation.  I don't think that anything I have done or am thinking of doing actually overlaps with what Reid has done, although it would be sensible to ensure that there is a smooth interface between them.</p>

<p><code>rw[mul_assoc (r0 ^ i) r0 s0,mul_assoc (r0 ^ i)]</code> -- I think mathlib convention is a space between <code>rw</code> and <code>[</code>, and also space after the comma.</p>
