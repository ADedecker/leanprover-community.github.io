<p>I think we ought to collect "formal roadmaps" consisting of material which would be suitable for mathlib but with the more difficult proofs skipped, to serve as potential projects for new contributors. To this end and as a starting point for discussion I've created <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1914" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1914">#1914</a>.</p>

<p>I have a couple more files in the works, but they depend on Urysohn's lemma, for which I intend to provide an actual proof.</p>
