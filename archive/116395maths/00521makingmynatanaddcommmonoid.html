<p>I was trying to prove that a home-rolled <code>nat</code> was an <code>add_comm_monoid</code>  in a way which was maximally mathematician-friendly, e.g. no leakage of <code>le</code> or <code>zero</code>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/bec5f90d5e0a012696420f0f2430bedb" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/bec5f90d5e0a012696420f0f2430bedb">see gist</a>.</p>
<p>My understanding of how Lean works is that I am supposed to come up with a canonical representative for things like mynat.zero -- I choose <code>0</code>, and similarly I choose <code>1</code> for <code>one</code>. That's right, right?</p>
<p>On line 56 I have a <code>zero</code> which is something I never really wanted to see again. Is there a more high-powered tactic which will preserve my choice for <code>0</code> as the "canonical representative" of <code>mynat.zero</code>? </p>
<p>Is there a tactic that makes that instance on line 77 by just matching on names?</p>
<p>Finally lines 142 and 146 -- what is the incantation which makes these? I am so bad at making structures. Let's say that you must make an instance of <code>add_semigroup mynat</code> before you make the instance of <code>add_comm_semigroup mynat</code>.</p>
