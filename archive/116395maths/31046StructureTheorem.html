<p>I want to prove the structure theorem of finitely generated modules over a PID in Lean. <br>
I'm trying to define free modules by isomorphic to direct sum <code>R^n</code>. <br>
But I don't understand why in <code>linear_algebra.direct_sum_module</code>, the indexing type  <code>iota</code> of a direct sum <code>direct_sum iota beta</code> needs to have decidable equality. In fact, I don't think I know what having "decidable equality" means.</p>
