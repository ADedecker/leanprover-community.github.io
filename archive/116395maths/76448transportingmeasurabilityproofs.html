<p>I am stuck in a proof where I have a seemingly trivial goal: <code>measurable (Î» (a : nnreal), a)</code>. <br>
Nothing I try seems to work! <br>
I guess the section on measurable equivalences was set up to solve goals like this, but I'm not able to use it. I'd appreciate any help!</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean about measurable equivalences. As always with this kind of thing, there are a hundred implicit arguments so that line is insufficient context</p>
