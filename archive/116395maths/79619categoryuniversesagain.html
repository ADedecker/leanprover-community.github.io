<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> While updating lean-homotopy-theory to current mathlib I (or actually lean) noticed that the current formula for the universe level of functors is wrong. Worse, it doesn't really seem to be possible to fix it.</p>

<p>The current formula is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">structure</span> <span class="n">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u₁</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">category</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">v₁</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">D</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u₂</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">category</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">v₂</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">max</span> <span class="n">v₁</span> <span class="n">v₂</span> <span class="n">u₁</span> <span class="n">u₂</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="c1">-- ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But this isn't right, because the homs of C and D live in <code>Sort v₁</code> and <code>Sort v₂</code> respectively not <code>Type v₁</code> and <code>Type v₂</code>.<br>
The correct formula would be</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">structure</span> <span class="n">functor</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u₁</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">category</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">v₁</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">D</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u₂</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">category</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">v₂</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span>

<p>For example, suppose C and D are both <code>small_category.{w}</code>. Then <code>v₁ = v₂ = w+1</code> and <code>u₁ = u₂ = w</code>. The type of functors from C to D should again be a <code>Type w</code>. But according to the current formula it is a <code>Type (w+1)</code>.<br>
This caused this definition to fail: <a href="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/category_theory/bundled.lean#L27" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/category_theory/bundled.lean#L27">https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/category_theory/bundled.lean#L27</a><br>
(I know <code>Cat</code> is in mathlib now, but I'd rather first get the current version of my library to build with current mathlib before taking advantage of new mathlib features.)</p>

<p>However, if we use the corrected formula, then we have a problem in <code>functor_category</code>: we want to make functors the objects of a category but they form a <code>Sort _</code>, not a <code>Type _</code>.</p>

<p>So making objects be a <code>Type u</code> and morphisms a <code>Sort v</code> isn't compatible with assigning the correct universe level to functors, as far as I can see.</p>

<p>I think there was a time when the objects of a category were a Sort as well, bu Scott changed it, and I think it might have just been because he couldn't think of a reason why anyone would do that.</p>
<p>I think Sort valued homs might not be as useful as anticipated at first because they don't really work with limits as they are not small categories according to Lean.</p>

<p>I think the solution is going to be to abandon again Sort-valued morphisms, which, as Chris says, have not ended up being usable.</p>

<p>So back to the original Type for both objects and morphisms then?</p>

<p>Maybe it's pointless, but am I right in thinking that we could also just allow <code>Sort 0</code> objects again and everything would be fine? (And perhaps Reid has given the first example of someone wanting to construct a category with <code>Sort 0</code> object?)</p>
<p>It's kinda nice having functors to <code>Prop</code></p>

<p>I agree that having functors to Prop is really nice, and the reason I started generalising to Sort was to allow this.</p>

<p>My student Yiming did a bunch of work trying to do transport-across-isomorphisms automatically, and it relied heavily on the possibility of Prop valued functors. Not having them would not make her work impossible, but there would be a lot of extra <code>plift</code>s, which hopefully would all be invisible to the user, but ...</p>
