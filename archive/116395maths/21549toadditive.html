<p>Hi, I think it would be nice to have the following features in <code>to_additive</code>:<br>
1. Automatically add constructors, <code>rec_on</code> etc. to the dictionary.<br>
2. Automatically add <code>attribute [to_additive name._proof_{{n}}] name._proof_{{n}}</code> <em>before</em> trying to transport <code>name</code>.<br>
Is it hard?</p>

<p>Those sound like good ideas. I don't think they should be too hard. There are a few tactics that crawl the environment looking for declarations. The only example I know well (because I wrote it) is <code>library_search</code>.</p>
