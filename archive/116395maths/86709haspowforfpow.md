<p>There's no <code>has_pow</code> instance for integer powers in a field, there's just <code>fpow</code>. Is there a reason why the notation isn't used for <code>fpow</code>?</p>

<p>maybe it was written before <code>has_pow</code>? I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> will know</p>
