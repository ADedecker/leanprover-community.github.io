This is my attempt to prove that non-cyclic groups exist in Lean. I had perhaps naively thought that I was going to get the whole way there with `dec_trivial`, but I've just realised that my claim that a group is not cyclic is not immediately decidable. For each element `g` I need to come up with an element `h` such that `h` is not in the cyclic group generated by `g`, which involves showing that for all integers `n`, `h` isn't `g^n`. This suddenly looks a bit more painful than I wanted it to be. Any ideas on how to proceed?

This is motivated by a second year problem sheet question: "True or false? If $$G$$ is abelian then $$G$$ is cyclic". [$$G$$ a group]

Why not use C_2^2?

oh right, and then there (should) be some lemmas about orders of elements in product

The issue is that proving something isn't cyclic involves checking that infinitely many calculations don't work out

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811631):
no, I mean `zmod 2 x zmod 2`

the problem is still there

I mean the problem I highlight is still there

It's just that there's less set-up ;-)

if you want to do it by dec_trivial, maybe prove that it suffices to consider n < |G| by Lagrange

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811661):
or even $$0\leq n<|G|$$. Is this already in Lean?

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811662):
You just check that for every element of the group there is a proper subgroup that contains it

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 18:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811669):
or maybe you could even do some pigeonhole argument

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811730):
or you could prove that `is_cyclic` is decidable and then decide it

If I do the Lagrange thing then it becomes `dec_trivial` again because @**Kenny Lau** recently PR'd a decidability instance for $$0\leq n<m$$ I believe

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811744):
Is `is_cyclic` decidable?

For infinite groups it sounds scary

for finite groups everything is decidable

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811758):
for finite groups I guess I believe you

right

It's easy to write a program to calculate the order of an element in a finite group, maybe Chris has already done it

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811829):
so you just run that on everything and it comes up less than |G| each time

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811834):
@**Chris Hughes** what do you recommend -- I suspect you know well what is there.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811846):
Definition of `is_cyclic` is not "there's an element of order equal to the order of the group" as this would not work for Z

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811858):
I see. So for finite groups one wants "is_cyclic iff exists element of order |G|"

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811865):
by the pigeonhole principle it works for finite groups though

#### [Mario Carneiro (Nov 05 2018 at 18:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811943):
technically, it does work for Z since it is cyclic

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Nov 05 2018 at 18:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146811947):

but it doesn't work for Z^2

People certainly talk about cyclic modules, and the fundamental theorem for them is that a module is cyclic iff it's isomorphic to $$R/I$$ for some ideal $$I$$ of the commutative ring $$R$$

Can you have a semimodule for nat whose underlying set is {0,1,2,3} and if you keep adding 1 you get the sequence 0,1,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...?

#### [Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 19:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/do non-cyclic groups exist?/near/146812965):
Yes

so the fundamental theorem has to deal with both the "tail" and the "loop"

eew and if the semiring is non-semiNoetherian then this might be pretty ghastly

I can see why they didn't catch on in the maths community

even if it's, like, $$\mathbb{N}^2$$ I think things will get complicated

Maybe the toric variety guys think about that case

don't they do submonoids of N^2 etc?

For N^2 you can imagine a wildly complicated module where the two generators ("up" and "right") get you through some maze and if you deviate beyond some perimeter then you have to go back to the start

no it can't be that crazy

The difficulty is that a congruence (an equivalence relation "~" such that a ~ a' and b ~ b' implies a + a' ~ b + b') is no longer uniquely determined by the set of a for which a ~ 0

I would need some sort of free semiring for that sort of fun

when forming the quotient of some algebraic object, you're really quotienting out by a congruence

it's just that the ability to subtract lets us identify congruences with (for example) submodules, so now submodules are also the things you can quotient by

wait -- I thought we were trying to prove that C_2 x C_2 wasn't cyclic

we seem to have wandered a bit

I still can't prove that Z/2 x Z/2 is not cyclic using dec_trivial. Here's an even easier instance of things failing:

```lean
import group_theory.order_of_element

@[derive decidable_eq]
inductive G : Type
| P : G
| M : G

namespace G

instance : fintype G := {
  elems := {P,M},
  complete := λ g, by cases g;simp
}

def mul : G → G → G
| P P := P
| P M := M
| M P := M
| M M := P

instance : group G :=
{ mul := mul,
  mul_assoc := dec_trivial,
  one := P,
  one_mul := dec_trivial,
  mul_one := dec_trivial,
  inv := id,
  mul_left_inv := dec_trivial
}

#eval to_bool (M ∈ finset.image (pow P) (finset.range (order_of P)))
-- #reduce to_bool (M ∈ finset.image (pow P) (finset.range (order_of P))) -- deterministic timeout

-- #eval to_bool (M ∈ gpowers P) -- maximum class-instance resolution depth has been reached

-- example : ¬ (M ∈ gpowers P) := dec_trivial -- max class-instance res

end G
```

Note also
```lean
#check @decidable_gpowers
/-
decidable_gpowers :
  Π {α : Type u_1} {a : α} [_inst_1 : group α] [_inst_2 : fintype α] [_inst_3 : decidable_eq α],
    decidable_pred (gpowers a)
