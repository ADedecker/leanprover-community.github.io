<p><code>induction</code> isn't documented in the tactics doc as far as I can see, and I think I need to use it in a slightly fancy way (is it <code>generalizing</code> I want here?). I have some slightly messy goal involving quantifying over all finite subsets of a type <code>K</code>. I want to prove the goal by induction on the size of the subset. In particular the inductive hypotheses in <code>data.set.finite</code> are not right for me -- they involve hypotheses of the form "if it's true for S then it's true for S union {x}" but what I can prove is that it's true for the empty subset, and if n&gt;=1 is the size of non-empty S, and if it's true for all subsets of S of size n-1, then it's true for S. </p>
<p>I can probably do this by explicitly copying my messy goal (which will mention typeclasses) and putting a "forall n" in front of it and an assumption which says n is the size of S, proving that this suffices, and then doing induction on n  -- but is there some cheap way to do this just using the <code>induction</code> tactic?</p>
