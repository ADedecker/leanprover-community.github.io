<p>Where can I find the following facts: <code>Z[x] is a commutative ring</code>, and <code>evaluation at x = i is a ring homomorphism</code>?</p>

<p>I don't think we have specialized to univariate polynomials, but <code>mv_polynomial</code> and an evaluation operation on it are defined in <code>multivariate_polynomial</code></p>

<p>Scott -- Kenny has been working on adjoint functors of various forgetful functors, and I pointed out to him that the adjoint of the forgetful functor from commutative rings to sets would give both of the things you ask about for free. Are you back to an internet connection yet? He should talk to you about category theory!</p>

<p>I opened <code>polynomial.lean</code> for the first time as I will need to show that the derivative of a polynomial (in the analytic sense) is given by the algebraic definition <code>p.derivative</code>. I was surprised to see that there is no coercion from <code>polynomial K</code> to <code>K -&gt; K</code>: to evaluate a polynomial <code>p</code> on <code>x</code>, one should write <code>p.eval x</code>. Do you know the reason for this?</p>

<p>Initially the coercion was to <code>p.coeff</code>... So <code>p n</code> would be the <code>n</code>th coefficient of <code>p</code>. Indeed, <code>coeff</code> wasn't even defined.</p>
