I proved the first lemma of my new bigop lib!

@**Mario Carneiro** Could you have a look to tell me if I started wrong, before I try to prove 50 more lemmas of this kind?

I think you can simply copy and paste the content of this file

It depends on nothing but mathlib

I'm especially curious about what you think about using `is_associative` and `is_left_id` here

Usually I love the old algebraic hierarchy but here it seems to me I wanted something directly attached to the operation

btw `[∀ i, decidable $ P i]` is just `[decidable_pred P]`

I hope you noticed my effort not to use the usual `non computable theory`/`local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable`

Actually I needed it in order to compute 5! in the examples...

I removed the `open classical` at the top and everything worked fine

@**Assia Mahboubi** could you have a look at this https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/01776fcb1eedc65df32e457427d06feacb321910/src/bigop.lean and tell me if this tiny starts means I can forget about the canonical instance propaganda, and Lean type class is doing just fine for the purpose of porting the bigop lib from Coq to Lean?

I think that `apply_bigop` can be removed and replaced by `list.foldr` of `list.filter`, although the notations seem okay (very stylish)

I wonder if the new lean 4 parser will permit stuff like python list comprehensions

Do you suggest I write `def apply_bigop  := foldr (λ i, op (F i)) nil (filter P r)` or completely remove `apply_bigop` and copy-paste the RHS everywhere I had `apply_bigop`?

If this happens it will become very hard to come up with something that Lean doesn't do great.

Writing lemmas with minimal hypotheses is so fun. I find myself having lemmas assuming `op` is associative with an element `nil` which is a left identity (`op nil a = a` for all `a`) but not a right identity. Then I keep the same hypothesis for the next lemma I find myself surprised to see I actually need right identity this time.

hypotheses are what you need to make your lemmas work. Axioms are what you need to make everything work.

I suspect `a * (b * c) = (d * e) * f` would work, right?

Will you eventually also formalize Kantorovitch’s theorem? The bigop paper mentions a whole bunch of results that seem to follow easily

I'm not interested in numerical analysis but I certainly intend to continue working on (multi-variable) calculus at some point. And I really hope we will have some linear algebra in the not too far distant future (it's a bit embarrassing to have schemes but no finite dimensional vector spaces...)

Did you see the short proof of Cayley-Hamilton Patrick? I can't remember where I saw it -- was it actually in the paper you're reading?

HI @**Patrick Massot**! Cool, this looks really promising! However, I am afraid that the potential problems will not show up at this stage (if ever).  The tricky part is the predictability and robustness of the algorithm inferring the *instances*. So for instance (foobar example) when writing \sum_(1 < p <= n | p prime) f ( \prod(x \ I_n) x),  i.e. you have to infer and combine different instances of monoids, on different types.

Hi Assia! Of course I have no idea how predictable and robust is the algorithm here. I only tried to use my lemmas in https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/master/src/support.lean where I got completely stuck because of natural numbers arithmetic (with the crazy non-properties of substraction). So I gave up and wait for https://github.com/skbaek/qelim to become usable

Thinking about more concrete benchmarks. A first test case could be the definition of the determinant of a matrix, as the sum over the elements of the symetric group, etc. Another good one might be Cayley Hamilton and friends (juggling with matrices of polynomials and polynomials over matrices).

Ok, I will probably try to define determinants. Of course the problem is everything takes forever, and I also have real work to do...
