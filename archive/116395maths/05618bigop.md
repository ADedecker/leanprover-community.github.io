I proved the first lemma of my new bigop lib!

I'm so happy :smile:

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509515):
@**Mario Carneiro** Could you have a look to tell me if I started wrong, before I try to prove 50 more lemmas of this kind?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509519):
I think you can simply copy and paste the content of this file

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509559):
It depends on nothing but mathlib

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509570):
I'm especially curious about what you think about using `is_associative` and `is_left_id` here

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509613):
Usually I love the old algebraic hierarchy but here it seems to me I wanted something directly attached to the operation

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:38)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509616):
btw `[∀ i, decidable $ P i]` is just `[decidable_pred P]`

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509621):
Good to know, thanks!

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509673):
I hope you noticed my effort not to use the usual `non computable theory`/`local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable`

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509676):
Actually I needed it in order to compute 5! in the examples...

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:40)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509677):
:D

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509679):
did you?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509685):
I removed the `open classical` at the top and everything worked fine

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509686):
and how does noncomputable things help with computation

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509688):
Right, I forgot to erase that line

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509730):
Which is the third line that is normally on top of all my Lean file before I start writing anything else

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 22 2018 at 01:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509740):
feature request: make it work with finset if your `op` is commutative

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509789):
@**Assia Mahboubi** could you have a look at this https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/01776fcb1eedc65df32e457427d06feacb321910/src/bigop.lean and tell me if this tiny starts means I can forget about the canonical instance propaganda, and Lean type class is doing just fine for the purpose of porting the bigop lib from Coq to Lean?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 01:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125509829):

Of course that on the TODO list

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 22 2018 at 02:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125510402):
I think that `apply_bigop` can be removed and replaced by `list.foldr` of `list.filter`, although the notations seem okay (very stylish)

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 22 2018 at 02:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125510443):
I wonder if the new lean 4 parser will permit stuff like python list comprehensions

#### [Mario Carneiro (Apr 22 2018 at 02:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125510595):
comparison:
```
/- python
>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
-/
#eval do x ← [1,2,3], y ← [3,1,4], guard (x ≠ y), return (x, y)

Do you suggest I write `def apply_bigop  := foldr (λ i, op (F i)) nil (filter P r)` or completely remove `apply_bigop` and copy-paste the RHS everywhere I had `apply_bigop`?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 11:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125523821):

If this happens it will become very hard to come up with something that Lean doesn't do great.

I created a separate repo, the new place to look at is https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/bigop.lean

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 22 2018 at 16:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125531681):
Every help is welcome

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 16:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125570257):
Writing lemmas with minimal hypotheses is so fun. I find myself having lemmas assuming `op` is associative with an element `nil` which is a left identity (`op nil a = a` for all `a`) but not a right identity. Then I keep the same hypothesis for the next lemma I find myself surprised to see I actually need right identity this time.

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 16:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125570261):

I thought someone doesn't care about which axioms we use

It's not about axioms, it's about hypotheses

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 16:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125570314):
aha

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 16:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125570316):
I fail to see any difference

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 23 2018 at 16:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125570328):
assuming AoC, omega <= a implies a^2 = a

hypotheses are what you need to make your lemmas work. Axioms are what you need to make everything work.

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125575735):
Oh, I have proof containing `rw assoc op,  rw ← assoc op, `

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125575784):
and it's not simplifiable

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576872):
That can happen if you have more than two multiplications

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576877):
because it just finds the first match

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576880):
sure

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576884):
that's what is happening here

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576885):
I suspect `a * (b * c) = (d * e) * f` would work, right?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576887):
But I agree it looks funny :-)

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576888):
it still looks funny

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 23 2018 at 18:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125576891):
heh

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125577124):
That one is also cute in a different direction: `simp [H', H h (by simp)]`

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 23 2018 at 18:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125577154):
nested `simp`!

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 24 2018 at 02:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125595701):
Two more lemmas tonight, culminating with https://github.com/PatrickMassot/bigop/blob/master/src/bigop.lean#L165. The needs some polishing but the statement is nice.

#### [Andrew Ashworth (Apr 24 2018 at 02:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125595848):
Will you eventually also formalize Kantorovitch’s theorem? The bigop paper mentions a whole bunch of results that seem to follow easily

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 24 2018 at 10:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125609667):
I'm not interested in numerical analysis but I certainly intend to continue working on (multi-variable) calculus at some point. And I really hope we will have some linear algebra in the not too far distant future (it's a bit embarrassing to have schemes but no finite dimensional vector spaces...)

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 24 2018 at 11:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125611380):
Did you see the short proof of Cayley-Hamilton Patrick? I can't remember where I saw it -- was it actually in the paper you're reading?

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 24 2018 at 11:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125612752):
It's mentioned in that paper but not spelled out

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 24 2018 at 11:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125612754):
I've already seen it though

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 24 2018 at 11:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/125612769):
But now I really need to work (understand an old paper by DBA Epstein which is not formalized, not even in automath)

#### [Assia Mahboubi (May 28 2018 at 11:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198065):
HI @**Patrick Massot**! Cool, this looks really promising! However, I am afraid that the potential problems will not show up at this stage (if ever).  The tricky part is the predictability and robustness of the algorithm inferring the *instances*. So for instance (foobar example) when writing \sum_(1 < p <= n | p prime) f ( \prod(x \ I_n) x),  i.e. you have to infer and combine different instances of monoids, on different types.

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 11:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198398):
Hi Assia! Of course I have no idea how predictable and robust is the algorithm here. I only tried to use my lemmas in https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/master/src/support.lean where I got completely stuck because of natural numbers arithmetic (with the crazy non-properties of substraction). So I gave up and wait for https://github.com/skbaek/qelim to become usable

#### [Assia Mahboubi (May 28 2018 at 11:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198413):
Thinking about more concrete benchmarks. A first test case could be the definition of the determinant of a matrix, as the sum over the elements of the symetric group, etc. Another good one might be Cayley Hamilton and friends (juggling with matrices of polynomials and polynomials over matrices).

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 12:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198587):
Ok, I will probably try to define determinants. Of course the problem is everything takes forever, and I also have real work to do...

#### [Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 12:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198673):
And it's lunch time
