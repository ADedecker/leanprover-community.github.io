<p>Do you suggest I write <code>def apply_bigop  := foldr (λ i, op (F i)) nil (filter P r)</code> or completely remove <code>apply_bigop</code> and copy-paste the RHS everywhere I had <code>apply_bigop</code>?</p>

<p>Writing lemmas with minimal hypotheses is so fun. I find myself having lemmas assuming <code>op</code> is associative with an element <code>nil</code> which is a left identity (<code>op nil a = a</code> for all <code>a</code>) but not a right identity. Then I keep the same hypothesis for the next lemma I find myself surprised to see I actually need right identity this time.</p>

<p>Will you eventually also formalize Kantorovitch’s theorem? The bigop paper mentions a whole bunch of results that seem to follow easily</p>

<p>I'm not interested in numerical analysis but I certainly intend to continue working on (multi-variable) calculus at some point. And I really hope we will have some linear algebra in the not too far distant future (it's a bit embarrassing to have schemes but no finite dimensional vector spaces...)</p>

<p>HI <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>! Cool, this looks really promising! However, I am afraid that the potential problems will not show up at this stage (if ever).  The tricky part is the predictability and robustness of the algorithm inferring the <em>instances</em>. So for instance (foobar example) when writing \sum_(1 &lt; p &lt;= n | p prime) f ( \prod(x \ I_n) x),  i.e. you have to infer and combine different instances of monoids, on different types.</p>

<p>Hi Assia! Of course I have no idea how predictable and robust is the algorithm here. I only tried to use my lemmas in <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/master/src/support.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/master/src/support.lean">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-scratchpad/blob/master/src/support.lean</a> where I got completely stuck because of natural numbers arithmetic (with the crazy non-properties of substraction). So I gave up and wait for <a href="https://github.com/skbaek/qelim" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/skbaek/qelim">https://github.com/skbaek/qelim</a> to become usable</p>

#### [ Assia Mahboubi (May 28 2018 at 11:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198413):
<p>Thinking about more concrete benchmarks. A first test case could be the definition of the determinant of a matrix, as the sum over the elements of the symetric group, etc. Another good one might be Cayley Hamilton and friends (juggling with matrices of polynomials and polynomials over matrices).</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (May 28 2018 at 12:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/bigop/near/127198587):
<p>Ok, I will probably try to define determinants. Of course the problem is everything takes forever, and I also have real work to do...</p>
