<p>I think it's time to update</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md</a></p>
<p>and it's also perhaps a good idea to write a list of stuff which we'd like to have in mathlib.</p>
<p>Everyone -- what maths would you like to see in mathlib? Some ideas are <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/311071/which-mathematical-definitions-should-be-formalised-in-lean" target="_blank" title="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/311071/which-mathematical-definitions-should-be-formalised-in-lean">on the mathoverflow question</a> -- which ones should be listed as "todo"? Are we ready for manifolds next? I don't know enough about the state of multivariable calculus in Lean to know how ready we are.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span> could you give me an update for these former WIPs? Did they happen? Will they happen? Shall I delete or edit those entries?</p>
<p>We should mention the work of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> and others on differentiable functions I guess.</p>
<p>I don't think we have power series in 1 variable (although it's easier to code than polynomials in one variable!), and I don't think we have the basic theory of Dedekind domains; both of these should be easily accessible nowadays.</p>

<p>I think it's time either get rid of that page or find someone who wants to take responsibility to update it. You can remove the line about calculus, and maybe indicate that SÃ©bastien is working on manifolds.</p>

<p>The documentation about what is already covered is also badly out of date, but I certainly intend to work on this once my teaching semester will be over</p>

<p>I don't have an opinion on how / whether to maintain that page, but I thought I would mention that a student here, Zhouhang (Joe) Zhou, has started working on integration. He is aiming to define the Bochner integral following advice from Johannes. If all goes well,  the plan is to also prove suitably general versions of the FTC to link integration and differentiation.</p>

<p>I agree we should get rid of that page, but I would really love to replace it with something better.</p>

<p>One option is to use the issues list on leanprover-community/mathlib.</p>

<p>We could tag things as "bug", "chore", "roadmap", "easy", "medium", "good-first-PR", etc.</p>

<p>Another option is trello, a "kanban board" app. I've used it in the past; it's very nice to use, but doesn't magically solve the problem of needing a commitment from a enough people to actually use it.</p>

<p>It seems there are reasonable integrations with zulip, github, and vscode.</p>

<p>I think writing a few "roadmaps" would be really helpful.</p>
