<p>I think it's time to update</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/wip.md</a></p>
<p>and it's also perhaps a good idea to write a list of stuff which we'd like to have in mathlib.</p>
<p>Everyone -- what maths would you like to see in mathlib? Some ideas are <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/311071/which-mathematical-definitions-should-be-formalised-in-lean" target="_blank" title="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/311071/which-mathematical-definitions-should-be-formalised-in-lean">on the mathoverflow question</a> -- which ones should be listed as "todo"? Are we ready for manifolds next? I don't know enough about the state of multivariable calculus in Lean to know how ready we are.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span> could you give me an update for these former WIPs? Did they happen? Will they happen? Shall I delete or edit those entries?</p>
<p>We should mention the work of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> and others on differentiable functions I guess.</p>
<p>I don't think we have power series in 1 variable (although it's easier to code than polynomials in one variable!), and I don't think we have the basic theory of Dedekind domains; both of these should be easily accessible nowadays.</p>
