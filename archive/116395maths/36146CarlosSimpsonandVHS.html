<p>Carlos Simpson (a mathematician) wrote <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computer-theorem-proving-in-math-Simpson/0eaefbebb10635e4218694653e6e1a4425a5a370" target="_blank" title="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computer-theorem-proving-in-math-Simpson/0eaefbebb10635e4218694653e6e1a4425a5a370">this article</a> on computer theorem proving in 2003. I'd not seen it until today. At the end of it he talks about formalising a proof that some space coming up in the study of variation of Hodge structures is negatively curved. If this sounds like a big deal today (and it does, to me) then perhaps it sounded like a massive deal in 2003. </p>
<p>In the last couple of pages of the paper, Simpson writes down a sketch of how he imagines this theorem should be proved in a computer proof checker. I don't want to quote it all here, it's about three pages long. But it might be interesting to know how far we have gone down this route and how feasible people think this plan is to pull off in Lean.</p>

<p>I particularly like that he refers to what I call mathematics as "standard mathematics" and all the constructive stuff as "exotic mathematics" :D</p>

<p>Incidentally, this is the same Simpson that found a mistake in Voevodsky's papers, and drove Voevodsky towards formalisation.</p>

<p>If the makers of other systems feel impelled at this point to say “hey, our system does just as well or better”, the main point I am trying to make is:  That’s great!  Try to get us working on it!</p>

<p>Once we have a reasonable control over the basic notions of ring, algebra, module etc. then much of commutative algebra can be done without any new notational worries.</p>

<p>And here we are... moaning about commutative diagrams and problems with really getting comm.alg. goin.</p>

<p>Do they have these problems in Coq? That was the system Carlos had experience in. </p>
<p>Of course the moans are only that stuff is annoyingly fiddly, not that it is impossible...</p>
