<p>Today I proved that <code>weak_univalence {α β : Sort*} : α ≃ β → α = β</code> and <code>quot.sound</code> imply choice as stated in Lean. You can get a weaker version of choice without <code>quot.sound</code>; this requires decidable equality on the type you're choosing from.<br>

<p>Curiously, Lean didn't ask me to mark the definition as noncomputable since I only used propositional axioms.</p>
<p>I copied the version of <code>em</code> from the HoTT book for part of this. It's much easier to understand than the Lean proof.</p>
