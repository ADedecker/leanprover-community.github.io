Am I doing it right? What is the use of `trunc`?

Do you get an error?

`trunc` is the quotient by the universal relation.  So for groups, `trunc α` is always a singleton.  You can use it e.g. to define an existential quantifier where you can computably use the witness, but still have (propositional) "proof" irrelevance.

I don't

```lean
/-- `trunc α` is the quotient of `α` by the always-true relation. This
  is related to the propositional truncation in HoTT, and is similar
  in effect to `nonempty α`, but unlike `nonempty α`, `trunc α` is data,
  so the VM representation is the same as `α`, and so this can be used to
  maintain computability. -/

So `trunc { x // x * x != 1 }` is a subsingleton like `∃ x, x * x != 1` but you can use the witness `x` to compute other data (as long as it does not depend on the concrete value of `x`)
