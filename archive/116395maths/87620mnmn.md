I remember struggling a lot with coercions when I was a beginner last year, and now I see my students struggling with them. Coming back to them now and thinking about them now I have more experience has really helped, because I understand far better what is going on and can answer many of my own questions now. 

Given that Lean holds the principle of good naming conventions in high regard, it's initially a bit surprising to see three (at least) conventions for the name of `↑(m * n) = ↑m * ↑n`, which is the statement of all three lemmas below:

```lean
#check @int.coe_nat_mul -- coercion from nat to int
#check @nat.cast_mul -- coercion from nat to a general semiring
#check @pnat.mul_coe -- coercion from pnat to nat
```

There are lots of confusing things going on here. The theorem from nat to int is called `int.something` (so it's a theorem about the target), the theorem from nat to real is called `nat.something` (so it's a theorem about the source), the up-arrow seems to being referred to as both a `cast` and a `coe` in naming conventions, with `coe` being used once when the namespace is the source and once when it's the target, and so on.

My vague impression is that this is happening because there are several competing things which people want, and we can't have them all at once. But Gabriel's comment from a few days ago has *greatly* clarified how one can work with these things without going insane searching for lemmas whose names one can't guess; if you want to find out what the theorem saying `↑(m * n) = ↑m * ↑n` from, say, rat to real, is called, then just write

```lean
import data.real.basic

set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true

example (x y : ℚ) : (((x * y) : ℚ) : ℝ) = (x : ℝ) * (y : ℝ) := by simp
```

because *when written in this form, `simp` will do it*. And now if you want to know the name of the theorem it used (perhaps because you want to use a rewrite instead, for some reason), just click on `simp` and see. 

I don't really understand why we have all these naming conventions, but at the end of the day this workaround to discover the names has worked several times for me.

Those days  I suffer a lot with coercions too. I think it's partly related to what Scott explained, with lemmas expecting the explicit conversion vs lemmas stated with coercions. But there is also lots of things like `(((x * y) : ℚ) : ℝ)` in my code, and this drives me crazy. I really don't want to see that `: ℚ` in the middle

Regarding naming: the usual name for the coercion is `coe`. The name `cast` is used specifically for the universal map from an initial algebra, and unlike most coercions it is named for the source not the target because the target is generic

When I wrote that above message I initially wrote `example (x y : ℚ) : ((x * y) : ℝ) = (x : ℝ) * (y : ℝ) := by simp` and it turned out that this was `rfl` :-)

yes, because Lean decided to insert a coercion too early

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969788):
As for the namespace, it's usually in the namespace if the "later" notion, because this the namespace we happen to be in when doing the definition

in that case it's fun, but in my case I don't have a multiplication on the bigger space

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969799):
you can avoid double ascription by putting up arrows in the appropriate places

```
example (x y : ℚ) : (↑(x * y) : ℝ) = ↑x * ↑y := by simp
```

(the up arrows on the right are optional)

#### [Guy Leroy (Aug 06 2018 at 12:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969961):
If the goal has arrows, is there a set_option to see the source and target of the coercion?

#### [Kenny Lau (Aug 06 2018 at 12:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969969):
`set_option pp.all true`

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969985):
unfortunately no, the best you can do is `pp.notation false` and `pp.implicit true` but this shows a ton of other irrelevant info

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969993):
or `pp.all true` which shows even more irrelevant info

#### [Guy Leroy (Aug 06 2018 at 12:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130969995):
Okay thanks

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 06 2018 at 12:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130970238):
I would strongly encourage `set_option pp.all true`. This shows how Lean is actually thinking about things, it shows far more information than you want, but the advantage is that it shows pretty much *all* the information, so all of a sudden you have a glimpse into the world of universes, type class inference, notation and everything else, all at once. I remember having one of those big clarifying experiences once when I set `pp.all true` on a relatively simple statement and then understood far more about what Lean was and how it worked.

you need `set_option pp.universe true` for even more information right

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130970264):
@**Sebastian Ullrich** Will Lean 4 have the ability to customize the pretty printer via tactics? For example if I wanted to implement `pp.coe_targets`

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Aug 06 2018 at 12:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130970364):
```quote
`example (x y : ℚ) : (↑(x * y) : ℝ) = ↑x * ↑y := by simp`
```
What is going on here? Why is that not the same as ` ((x * y) : ℝ)`? There's something simple I'm missing.

#### [Mario Carneiro (Aug 06 2018 at 12:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/%E2%86%91%28m%20%2A%20n%29%20%3D%20%E2%86%91m%20%2A%20%E2%86%91n/near/130970460):
Coercions are always inserted as late as possible in elaboration, when something clearly has the wrong type. Since elaboration works from the outside in, this has the effect of pushing arrows to the tightest scope
