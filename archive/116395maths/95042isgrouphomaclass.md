<p>I was surprised to hear <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> saying in Paris that he thought <code>is_group_hom</code> should not be a class. The problem is that people often compose group homomorphisms by simply composing them rather than using <code>function.comp</code> or the notation for it. On the other hand, the last time I looked, <code>is_group_hom</code> was indeed a class. Should there be a discussion about whether this is the correct decision?</p>

<p>either make is_group_hom not a class, or make is_linear_map a class, I say</p>

<p>I agree with that. The current inconsistency is because different parts of the algebraic hierarchy were written by different people with different opinions</p>

<p>and at different times</p>
