I was surprised to hear @**Johannes HÃ¶lzl** saying in Paris that he thought `is_group_hom` should not be a class. The problem is that people often compose group homomorphisms by simply composing them rather than using `function.comp` or the notation for it. On the other hand, the last time I looked, `is_group_hom` was indeed a class. Should there be a discussion about whether this is the correct decision?

either make is_group_hom not a class, or make is_linear_map a class, I say

I agree with that. The current inconsistency is because different parts of the algebraic hierarchy were written by different people with different opinions

and at different times
