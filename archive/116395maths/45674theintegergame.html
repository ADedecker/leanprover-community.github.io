<p>One of the things that really surprised me about core Lean two years ago was that the integers were defined in this really mathematically ugly way, as the disjoint union of two copies of the naturals. As any mathematician knows, the integers are actually defined to be the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. I probably asked this two years ago but was in no position to understand the response, so I'm asking again now: why are the integers defined in this way? If I never want to compute with an actual integer, but just want to prove theorems about them (e.g. that they're a ring), then am I actually better off defining them as equivalence classes?</p>

<p>I think that's likely</p>

<p>As you've identified, the reason this is done is for computation</p>
