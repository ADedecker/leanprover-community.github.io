<p>I've been working on formalizing incidence geometry in Lean as an exercise and came across the following question: when we say that a set of points are collinear, do they necessarily have to be distinct?</p>

<p>Also, does it make sense to say that zero points or one point is/are (trivially) collinear?</p>

<p>Thanks, so I suppose it's fine either way?</p>

<p>I guess if I were using these words I would be clear about what I meant in these edge cases</p>

<p>If you literally have a <code>set</code> of points, then its members are distinct by definition</p>

<p>My usual message every time someone mentions that formalization project: if you are serious about it, you should have a look at <a href="https://geocoq.github.io/GeoCoq/" target="_blank" title="https://geocoq.github.io/GeoCoq/">https://geocoq.github.io/GeoCoq/</a></p>

<p>And GeoCoq is also a cautionary example of how hard the kind of issues you are asking about are: their definition of orthocenter is wrong (a right triangle has no orthocenter according to their definition, while the orthocenter should be defined as the vertex at the right angle) because of a definition of orthogonality which excludes certain points from being equal.</p>

<p>You are right our definition is wrong, because it does not include the case of the right triangle  ! thank you for pointing this. It has to be noted that we even proved Lemma orthocenter_per : ∀ A B C H, Per A B C →is_orthocenter H A B C → H=B. without noticing that the hypotheses imply False !<br>
The orthocenter is not used much in GeoCoq, I guess by using it more we would have detected this error.</p>

<p>Our are right that giving good definitions is not always as trivial as it looks. My favorite example of this is the definition of a point being inside an angle. if you say that  a point P is inside an angle ABC if there are points X and Y such that P belongs to segment XY: this definition works nicely in euclidean geometry, but does not work in neutral geometry. This confusion led to a flawed proof by Legendre of the parallel postulate.</p>

<p>About collinearity, we have in GeoCoq, a predicate Col taking only three points as input, and Col A A B holds. Then we have a tactic to deal with pseudo-transitivity of collinearity: A&lt;&gt;B -&gt; Col A B P -&gt; Col  A B Q -&gt; Col A B R -&gt; Col P Q R. I think it is convenient to allow in the definition of Col equal points because in many case you do not know if the point are distinct.<br>
In education, and in the Elements, there is some kind of implicit assumptions that points are in general position, but when you do it in Coq, you have a lot of problems with degenerated cases.</p>
