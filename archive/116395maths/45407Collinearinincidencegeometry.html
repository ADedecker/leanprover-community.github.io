<p>I've been working on formalizing incidence geometry in Lean as an exercise and came across the following question: when we say that a set of points are collinear, do they necessarily have to be distinct?</p>

<p>Also, does it make sense to say that zero points or one point is/are (trivially) collinear?</p>

<p>That's all up to the person who is using those words.</p>

<p>Thanks, so I suppose it's fine either way?</p>

<p>I guess if I were using these words I would be clear about what I meant in these edge cases</p>
