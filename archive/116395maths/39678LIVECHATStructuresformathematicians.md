<p>At 8pm UK time (2000 BST, so 1900 GMT) I am going to a live Lean explanation, in this thread, of a very simple mathlib file which defines a (non-inductive) structure. Mathematicians need to learn how to make structures, it's something we do very differently in mathematics. Here we need a far more formal kind of interface. I will hopefully do a few of these. It's like "talking people through mathlib files".</p>

<p>youtube live?</p>

<p>No, it seems "Zulip live"</p>

<p>Johan, I was inspired to do it after looking at the structure you constructed, which reminded me of the terrible first structure I constructed.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267673):
<p>Hello, this is just me talking through <code>pnat.lean</code></p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267674):
<p>It should be easy</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267678):
<p>and maybe people will find it later.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267695):
<p>Ok so mathematicians use a lot of structures, and one structure I was brought up on is "the UK mathematician's nat", namely {1,2,3,...}</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267698):
<p>Ok so how do we define the UK mathematician's nat?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267701):
<p>Well pretty clearly we could define it like the computer scientist's nat := {0,1,2,3,...}</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267702):
<p>we could just make a structure</p>

<p>it's not a structure</p>

<p>it's an inductive type</p>

<p>So there's pnat</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267825):
<p>and that would work</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267870):
<p>and we could define addition and multiplication and prove addition is commutative</p>

<p>and do all that stuff again</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267877):
<p>and that's stuff we already did with nat</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267879):
<p>and that's kind of a waste</p>

<p>it would be nice to inherit all those theorems about nat and get them to pnat immediately</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267896):
<p>so let's take a look at what they did in Lean or mathlib, wherever they defined pnat</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267932):
<p>Ok so it's in mathlib</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267936):
<p>which means that computer scientists are not interested in this structure</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (May 29 2018 at 21:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/LIVE%20CHAT%3A%20Structures%20for%20mathematicians/near/127267939):

<p>they don't define it using an inductive structure like nat</p>

<p>and in particular in a couple of weeks when I am supposed to be teaching a bunch of mathematicians Lean and they don't know how to make structures</p>
