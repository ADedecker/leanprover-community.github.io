<p>Do we want polynomials over a semiring? If we do, then it's really necessary to have a way of expressing <code>zero_ne_one</code> as a class for semirings. I'm trying to prove some lemmas now for semirings, not because I care about semirings, but they are true in a semiring so I may as well prove it. It's very hard without <code>degree_X</code>.</p>
