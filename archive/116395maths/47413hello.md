<p>No. I would have no idea what "maffs" means if I hadn't seen Sebastian question</p>

<p>Kenny, did you create it yourself?</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482933):
<p>yes</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482934):
<p>I thought only admins could do that</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482935):
<p>I vote you rename it to math</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482937):
<p>It's less specific than mathlib</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482976):

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482984):
<p>I can't do it either</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482985):
<p>From <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maffs" target="_blank" title="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maffs">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maffs</a> it seems you need to have been a student in an English speaking country to understand this word</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482987):

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Apr 01 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483082):

#### [ Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483084):
<p>Now we can bikeshed about maths vs math forever.</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483122):

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483181):
<p>maths?</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Apr 01 2018 at 16:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124491045):
<p>Although this whole chat sometimes gets frivolous, I think "maffs" is taking a bit too far. I don't care either way between maths (UK English) and math (US English) but either of them are infinitely preferable to the meme IMO.</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 16:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124491051):
<p>long live meme</p>
