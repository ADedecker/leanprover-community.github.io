#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482926):
No. I would have no idea what "maffs" means if I hadn't seen Sebastian question

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482927):
it's a meme

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482930):
Kenny, did you create it yourself?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482933):
yes

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482934):
I thought only admins could do that

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482935):
I vote you rename it to math

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482937):
It's less specific than mathlib

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482976):
I'm afraid I can't rename it

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482979):
What about deleting it?

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482984):
I can't do it either

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482985):
From https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maffs it seems you need to have been a student in an English speaking country to understand this word

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482987):
@**Sebastian Ullrich** Can you delete this stream?

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Apr 01 2018 at 10:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483069):
I renamed it. Do tell me if you decide on a different name.

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483071):

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483072):

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Apr 01 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483082):

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483083):

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483084):
Now we can bikeshed about maths vs math forever.

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483122):

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483127):

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Apr 01 2018 at 10:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483128):

#### [Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483130):
The bikesheder

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Apr 01 2018 at 10:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483135):
math(ε|s)

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124483181):
maths?

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Apr 01 2018 at 16:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124491045):
Although this whole chat sometimes gets frivolous, I think "maffs" is taking a bit too far. I don't care either way between maths (UK English) and math (US English) but either of them are infinitely preferable to the meme IMO.

#### [Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 16:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124491051):
long live meme
