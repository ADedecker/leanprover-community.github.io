No. I would have no idea what "maffs" means if I hadn't seen Sebastian question

I thought only admins could do that

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482935):
I vote you rename it to math

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Apr 01 2018 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482937):
It's less specific than mathlib

What about deleting it?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kenny Lau (Apr 01 2018 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/hello/near/124482984):

From https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maffs it seems you need to have been a student in an English speaking country to understand this word

I renamed it. Do tell me if you decide on a different name.

maths?

Although this whole chat sometimes gets frivolous, I think "maffs" is taking a bit too far. I don't care either way between maths (UK English) and math (US English) but either of them are infinitely preferable to the meme IMO.
