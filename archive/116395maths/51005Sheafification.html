<p>Is sheafification defined in <a href="https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme">https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme</a>? I might have just missed it or there's a good reason for it not being added. I would be happy to work on a pull request if there's interest</p>
