Does anyone know how hard it would be to implement the sigma sum in Lean?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Aug 01 2018 at 17:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/sigma/near/130722757):
As in, big operators?

As in summing the numbers from 1 to n

and ideally summing over the elements of a set

There is a `big_operators.lean` file.

In `algebra/`

And I think Patrick has a project that is causing him royal pains. But it should allow for easier handling of these beasts.

I think @**Chris Hughes** might have also done some stuff with this. It's a good question! To answer an M1F question I needed to prove that $$\Sigma_{i=1}^na_i=\Sigma_{j=1}^na_{n+1-j}$$ and I don't think I ever managed to do this; I think Mario explained a technique which would have worked but I never got around to implementing it. I'd like to see basic facts about series manipulation all in some library, and if it's a bit too low-brow for mathlib we could put it in Xena's library.
