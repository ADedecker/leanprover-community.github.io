<p>I just had a look at Tucker's paper "The Lorenz attractor exists" <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0764-4442(99)80439-X" target="_blank" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0764-4442(99)80439-X">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0764-4442(99)80439-X</a> a 6-page (or really 5-page) summary of his proof that the Lorenz attractor exists and exhibits chaotic behaviour. The proof seems to rely on a bunch of C programs to do a whole lot of estimates. Some bright young things interested in getting analytical stuff up and going in Lean could probably do worse than build toward formal verification of some of these.</p>
