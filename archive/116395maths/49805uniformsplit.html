<p>I put a lot of work in splitting the uniform space + topological structure + completions mess, in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split</a> But I'm stuck in type class hell. After two suspicious fix in exponential.lean and operator_norm.lean, I'm stuck again in bounded_continuous_map.lean. Clearly there is something wrong, and I can't find what. Help would be very much appreciated <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid it wont' be possible to help without checking out the branch and try to make it compile</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="210574">@Patrick Massot</span> I think a problem is the <code>has_coe α (completion α) </code> instance for uniform space completions. At last comparing the type class searches for the old and new version it looks like it diverges at this point.</p>
<p>I don't know how the completion mechanism works exactly. But we have transitivity rules. Maybe this means the type class mechanism will try to find a compitions of <code>α -&gt; (completion α) -&gt; (completion (completion α) ) -&gt; ...</code>. I think we need to remove this completion. I guess we should remove this coercion.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for investigating</p>

<p>I managed to fix the build by providing an explicit instance term. But I shows once again that the type class mechanism is very brittle</p>
