Is every complete lattice compact? Here the topology is generated by sets of the form {x | a < x < b}

correction: the topology is generated by sets of the form {x | a < x < b} and {x | a < x} and {x | x < b}

I don't really understand the question but are the real numbers a counterexample?

it isn't a complete lattice

at least complete linear orders on a second countable topology form a complete lattice
compact (UNIV :: 'a::{complete_linorder,linorder_topology,second_countable_topology} set)

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Aug 24 2018 at 09:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Is%20every%20complete%20lattice%20compact%3F/near/132681108):
In Isabelle the proof goes over:
```isabelle
lemma compact_complete_linorder:
  fixes X :: "nat ⇒ 'a::{complete_linorder,linorder_topology}"
  shows "∃l r. strict_mono r ∧ (X ∘ r) ⇢ l"
```

`strict_mono` means strictly increasing
