<p>Hi. I'm from the computer science contingency of Lean users, but I'm going through 'Understanding Analysis' to try some very basic 'proper math' in Lean. Many of the proofs use arguments that are classics, but either aren't very Lean-friendly or aren't constructive. As an example, the proof of <code>irrat (sqrt 2)</code> used in the book is the proof by contradiction/infinite descent.</p>
<p>Is the approach you guys have taken (or would take) for math education to say "Well here's how these are done in Lean/mathlib, the sooner you get used to doing things this way the better", or is it to try and power through the classic definitions in Lean? Or are you trying to give equal time to both approaches?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
