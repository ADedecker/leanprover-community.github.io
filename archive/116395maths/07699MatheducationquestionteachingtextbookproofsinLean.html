<p>Hi. I'm from the computer science contingency of Lean users, but I'm going through 'Understanding Analysis' to try some very basic 'proper math' in Lean. Many of the proofs use arguments that are classics, but either aren't very Lean-friendly or aren't constructive. As an example, the proof of <code>irrat (sqrt 2)</code> used in the book is the proof by contradiction/infinite descent.</p>
<p>Is the approach you guys have taken (or would take) for math education to say "Well here's how these are done in Lean/mathlib, the sooner you get used to doing things this way the better", or is it to try and power through the classic definitions in Lean? Or are you trying to give equal time to both approaches?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We certainly don't worry about being constructive. Usually</p>

<p>If something in mathlib differs from theclassical definition it's because it's in a greater generality, in which case the classical definition is better to formalize.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="228466">@Chris B</span> What do you mean when you say "Many of the proofs ... either aren't very Lean-friendly"? If there are proofs in the library that can be optimized to become more Lean friendly, I think we very much welcome those.</p>

<p>Some of our contributors care more about being constructive than others. But in general, we unashamedly celebrate the axiom of choice.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> Sorry, I meant "the proofs in the textbook aren't always Lean-friendly" in that some of the things they take for granted don't seem trivial in Lean. I'm sure the ones in mathlib are great.</p>

<p>What is an example of a non-Lean friendly proof? I don't understand the issue with the irrationality of sqrt 2 example.</p>

<p>Aha... I see. And I'm sure there are also lots of proofs in mathlib that could be improved. But yes... most maths is not "designed to be formalised" to quote Mario out of context.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> Yes, that's the book. Maybe 'lean-aware' is a better choice of words than 'lean friendly'. The <code>irrat sqrt 2</code> proof is simple, but it's  not aware of the behavior/interaction between Lean's number types or the fact that rewriting terms in Lean is not always as easy as it is on paper, so as someone who's not super familiar with mathlib it's not trivial to recreate in terms of time and might end up brittle, ugly etc. On the other hand, there is also a definition of <code>irrat sqrt 2</code> in mathlib that is different but was written by someone who IS aware of those things.</p>
<p>The question was whether educators who were using Lean and had a similar pair of proofs (one from mathlib and one from a textbook) were choosing to focus on one or the other.</p>

<p>Maybe we should move this conversation to the "Lean for teaching" stream. When I use Lean for teaching I only use mathlib for its tactics and definition of real numbers. For instance I redefine limits of sequences and functions. I cannot expect my first year students to understand mathlib's use of filters and uniform spaces... This is the same reason we don't use Bourbaki for teaching. The good news is we can still use Lean (and mathlib tactics).</p>
