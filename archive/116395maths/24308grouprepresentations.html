<p>Is there any representation theory in Mathlib? I can't seem to find any. If there isn't, how would I go about defining a representation, characters, and stating/proving things like Schur's Lemma? I've been fuddling around and need a little guidance.</p>

<p>I think someone asked the same question a month back, you should be able to find the thread by searching zulip for representation theory</p>
