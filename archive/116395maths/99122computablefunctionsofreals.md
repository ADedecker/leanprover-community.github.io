In my "ordinary maths" research I was confronted with the paper "Computable functions of reals" by Tent and Ziegler, which is really funny because:
* Already on the first page it talks about nat-subtraction $$\stackrel{\cdot}{-}$$.
* It is about computational classes, about which I know nothing
* This felt like stuff which might be pretty Lean-able.
Here's a link to the paper: http://home.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/ziegler/preprints/periods.pdf

I'dd like to hear whether others think that these *lower-elementary* and *elementary* functions are close to be Leanable or not.

Noooooooooo!

Did I say something wrong?

Johan, please delete that thread before Mario sees it!

@**Mario Carneiro** Did you see this thread already, or can I still delete it?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 15:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/computable%20functions%20of%20reals/near/148865111):
Remember we still need to be able to handle modules over several base rings

Now is not a good time to tempt Mario with computability questions

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Nov 30 2018 at 15:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/computable%20functions%20of%20reals/near/148865167):
Right, and there are like 8 PRs on category theory waiting to be merged...

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 15:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/computable%20functions%20of%20reals/near/148865172):
That too

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 15:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/computable%20functions%20of%20reals/near/148865198):
Except you, Reid and Scott keep changing everything, and even you don't understand anymore what PR depends on what, and what PR is obsolete

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Patrick Massot (Nov 30 2018 at 15:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/computable%20functions%20of%20reals/near/148865226):
So I guess Mario and Johannes wisely wait for dust to settle

what about my 2 PR about ring theory
