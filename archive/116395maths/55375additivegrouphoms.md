<p>This has come up before. I need additive group homs. I can duplicate Patrick's work on group homs, but I also saw <code>@[to_additive finsupp.sum_map_range_index]</code> in <code>data/finsupp.lean</code>. Can someone explain to me how that magic works? Would it be enough to sprinkle some <code>@[to_additive ...]</code>'s into <code>algebra/group.lean</code> to have everything work?</p>

<p>the long term approach would be to learn a bit about tactics and understand how to_additive works, which is for automatically moving theorems from multiplicative groups to additive groups... unfortunately, learning tactics in Lean is a bit of a chore right now since Programming in Lean is unfinished</p>

<p>the magic of <code>to_additive</code> is a search and replace of all <code>to_additive</code> constants in the definition of the constant. Afterwards the additive, multiplicative constant pair is added to the <code>to_additive</code> database. By using <code>attribute [to_additive a_c] m_c</code> you add a new relation. The requirement is that the additive constants are an exact mirror of the multiplicative ones.</p>

<p>So, if I understand you correctly, it shouldn't be too complicated to sprinkle <code>@to_additive</code> in <code>algebra/group.lean</code>. Is that right?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127063451):
<p>Ok, so here is something that I am a bit worried about: in mathematics the notion of an "additive" group is really just notation (though pretty useful!). In Lean we have "groups" and "additive groups" and now we have <code>is_group_hom</code> and <code>is_add_group_hom</code>. But we also need mixed homomorphisms (from a multiplicative group to an additive group, and vice versa). For example, exp and log are such mixed homomorphisms. So all of a sudden, we have 4 notions of group homomorphisms. And now we want to compose these guys. So we need 8 composition lemmas. And I proved the 5 lemma some time ago: it has 10 groups in its statements. But any of those can be an "additive" group (and this occurs in nature!). Does that mean we need 1024 statements of the Five Lemma?</p>

<p>The additive / multiplicative group thing has a long history, and we are still debating the best way to do it</p>

<p>I feel like I would rather just remove <code>add_group</code> entirely. But I don't see through all the ramifications</p>

<p>Yes, but I think that that <code>to_additive</code> magic will replace <em>all</em> occurences of mul with add</p>

<p>So, if we didn't have all the "multiplicative" connotations with our groups... but just <code>op_neu</code> instead of <code>mul_one</code>. Would that be helpful?</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you say that a class <code>is_add_group_hom</code> is fine. But we shouldn't have classes for mixed homomorphisms. If one of those pops up, just turn it into an <code>is_group_hom</code>with <code>multiplicative</code>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>And the homomorphisms between them are somehow a bit involved... You take an alternating sum of (n+1) maps from <code>X (n+1)</code> to <code>X n</code>, and those induce maps between those additive groups.</p>

<p>If you want to prove something about an abstract group, and you would like to use infix <code>*</code> notation, then inside the proof you can make the group into an instance of <code>has_mul</code> (I hope) and voila, you have your <code>*</code>.

<p>it's not easier to read</p>

<p>the names are less obvious</p>

<p>For the generic theorems. Because those can be applied transparently to both settings</p>

<p>I see no advantages</p>

<p>it can't be applied transparently though</p>

<p>I think they are just as easy to use (or easier, in the mixed setting).</p>

<p>it is as easy to apply a neutral theorem to an additive setting as it is to apply a multiplicative theorem in an additive setting</p>

<p>If every <code>add_group</code> is an instance of <code>generic_group</code>, and I prove the five lemma for generic groups, then I can just apply it to additive groups, right?</p>

<p>Without any <code>multiplicative</code> stuff</p>

<p>You see, when I have my mathematician hat on I never think about whether my group is additive or multiplicative. I just use it. And I just use theorems. And it works.</p>

<p>I never had to deal with this in metamath either</p>

<p>So I don't want end users to have to figure out themselves where they need to use <code>multiplicative</code> to make some generic theorem work</p>

<p>we do have an algebra hierarchy that mario doesn't use though</p>

<p>in that hierarchy this problem is avoided, I think</p>

<p>Leo has his own ideas about generic groups. Like I said, this issue has a long history</p>

<p>The core lean impl is unfinished though, maybe lean 4 will have something workable</p>

<p>Honestly I have had more conversations on this topic than I would like, and things have not changed as a result</p>

<p>I don't mean to be short with you, but everyone has an idea and every solution has pros and cons</p>

<p>I would suggest not entering the ring unless you have a large amount of testing to support your claims</p>

<p>I don't see any reason to avoid some kind of primacy between the notations</p>

<p>This is a concept alien to mathematicians, that's why Johan is talking about it. But, like division by zero, it's just something we have to learn.</p>
