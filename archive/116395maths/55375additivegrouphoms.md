This has come up before. I need additive group homs. I can duplicate Patrick's work on group homs, but I also saw `@[to_additive finsupp.sum_map_range_index]` in `data/finsupp.lean`. Can someone explain to me how that magic works? Would it be enough to sprinkle some `@[to_additive ...]`'s into `algebra/group.lean` to have everything work?

already there is a little magic going on

the long term approach would be to learn a bit about tactics and understand how to_additive works, which is for automatically moving theorems from multiplicative groups to additive groups... unfortunately, learning tactics in Lean is a bit of a chore right now since Programming in Lean is unfinished

#### [Andrew Ashworth (May 23 2018 at 21:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/126991559):
well, actually, now that I'm looking at `algebra/group.lean`, you don't need to know much about tactics to understand what's going on there

#### [Johan Commelin (May 23 2018 at 21:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/126991753):

this is also valid, but unfortunately if you get stuck there is no solutions manual available to unstuck you, whereas such a thing exists for Software Foundations... the solutions manual known as Mario is asleep right now

#### [Johannes HÃ¶lzl (May 23 2018 at 21:41)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/126993084):
the magic of `to_additive` is a search and replace of all `to_additive` constants in the definition of the constant. Afterwards the additive, multiplicative constant pair is added to the `to_additive` database. By using `attribute [to_additive a_c] m_c` you add a new relation. The requirement is that the additive constants are an exact mirror of the multiplicative ones.

#### [Johan Commelin (May 23 2018 at 21:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/126993161):
So, if I understand you correctly, it shouldn't be too complicated to sprinkle `@to_additive` in `algebra/group.lean`. Is that right?

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:07)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127063451):
Ok, so here is something that I am a bit worried about: in mathematics the notion of an "additive" group is really just notation (though pretty useful!). In Lean we have "groups" and "additive groups" and now we have `is_group_hom` and `is_add_group_hom`. But we also need mixed homomorphisms (from a multiplicative group to an additive group, and vice versa). For example, exp and log are such mixed homomorphisms. So all of a sudden, we have 4 notions of group homomorphisms. And now we want to compose these guys. So we need 8 composition lemmas. And I proved the 5 lemma some time ago: it has 10 groups in its statements. But any of those can be an "additive" group (and this occurs in nature!). Does that mean we need 1024 statements of the Five Lemma?

Use `multiplicative` to do these kind of things

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064381):
But, doesn't that mean we should use `multiplicative` all the time?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064392):
The additive / multiplicative group thing has a long history, and we are still debating the best way to do it

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064404):
Ok, I see. I can understand that it might be delicate to pick the correct approach

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064456):
`multiplicative` is useful for post hoc fitting a multiplicative theorem in an additive or mixed-additive use case

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064464):
I feel like I would rather just remove `add_group` entirely. But I don't see through all the ramifications

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064467):
`to_additive` is useful for preparing theorems up front *with new names* and statements

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064508):
It's very confusing to apply `mul_one` when you want to simplify `x + 0 = x`

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064513):
Yes, but I think that that `to_additive` magic will replace *all* occurences of mul with add

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064515):
yes, that's the idea

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064516):
Or can you also use it to create mixed statements?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064522):
it's not very smart, it usually fails on mixed statements

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064551):
like `gpow`, which has an interplay between the additive semiring N and the group in question

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064565):
those translations had to be done manually, and in that case usually `multiplicative` is easier

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064577):
So, if we didn't have all the "multiplicative" connotations with our groups... but just `op_neu` instead of `mul_one`. Would that be helpful?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064621):
Jeremy likes this idea. I think it's the worst of both worlds

If you could somehow have some magic that infers whether you use `*` or `+` notation, I feel like it would give a very nice fusion.

But why do you think it is worse?

It's less mnemonic than either add_zero or mul_one

some of that magic goes beyond what lean will currently do on its own

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064681):
Yes, but having a lot of `gsmul` sprinkled through your goal is also not very helpful

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064683):
but then it gets into extending lean, which gets messy

Well, I was playing around with `multiplicative` a bit. And I think it gave me those `gsmul`'s

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 06:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064735):

I think I will just wait to see what you and Jeremy work out.

What are you trying to do exactly?

If I understand you correctly, you say that a class `is_add_group_hom` is fine. But we shouldn't have classes for mixed homomorphisms. If one of those pops up, just turn it into an `is_group_hom`with `multiplicative`. Is that correct?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 06:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064852):

Because if we also have classes for the mixed homomorphisms, then you do need 8 composition rules. And I feel like you run head first into some cambrian explosion.

So, shouldn't I just get rid of `is_add_group_hom` as well? And just use `multiplicative` immediately?

#### [Mario Carneiro (May 25 2018 at 07:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127064914):

And the homomorphisms between them are somehow a bit involved... You take an alternating sum of (n+1) maps from `X (n+1)` to `X n`, and those induce maps between those additive groups.

So you can use `is_group_hom` + `multiplicative` to define `is_add_group_hom`, and then most of the theorems will defeq carry over (although they may need to be restated)

Ok, so here is another ignorant question:
The reason we have infix notation `*` for every `group` is because they are instances of `has_mul`, right?

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 08:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127067516):
So what if we made abstract groups, with `op` and `neu` etc...

And then we have concrete groups (like the units in `rat`, or `int`) and we make those instances of `has_mul` resp. `has_add`

#### [Johan Commelin (May 25 2018 at 08:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/additive%20group%20homs/near/127067527):

And then we can have some `to_multiplicate` resp. `to_additive` magic, that will turn `op_neu` into `mul_one` resp. `add_zero`

If you want to prove something about an abstract group, and you would like to use infix `*` notation, then inside the proof you can make the group into an instance of `has_mul` (I hope) and voila, you have your `*`. But the statement that you proved is all of a sudden also valid in the context of additive notation.

If you use `has_mul` then it gets involved in the statements of the theorems you prove, so there is some unfolding to apply it in a given context

I never had to deal with this in metamath either

So I don't want end users to have to figure out themselves where they need to use `multiplicative` to make some generic theorem work

it was all local notation

we do have an algebra hierarchy that mario doesn't use though

in that hierarchy this problem is avoided, I think

Leo has his own ideas about generic groups. Like I said, this issue has a long history

The core lean impl is unfinished though, maybe lean 4 will have something workable

Honestly I have had more conversations on this topic than I would like, and things have not changed as a result

I just want to prove theorems and use what's there

Ok. Got that.

I really don't want to start any fights of course. I really love what you have done so far.

I don't mean to be short with you, but everyone has an idea and every solution has pros and cons

I would suggest not entering the ring unless you have a large amount of testing to support your claims

Yeah, that's good advice.

I don't see any reason to avoid some kind of primacy between the notations

This is a concept alien to mathematicians, that's why Johan is talking about it. But, like division by zero, it's just something we have to learn.

They have different customs here.

Did we get anywhere with this additive group homs thread? @**Mario Carneiro** what is the definition you recommend in the end?
