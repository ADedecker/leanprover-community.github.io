<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> How far are we from being able to define a Riemannian manifold? It seems to me that almost all the ingredients are in place. If so, that sounds like a pretty nice milestone!</p>

<p>Not so close. The main missing block is to define the bundle of metrics. Two possible choices: define it by hand, or define a general mechanism associating to a vector bundle and a functor a new vector bundle. The general version would be better, but I have never played with the category theory library...</p>
