@**Scott Morrison|110087**, how are the new limits coming along? I took a peek at community mathlib and it looks like things are happening!

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086701):
Yes, I think it's pretty close now.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086760):
I spent (too long) trying to follow the argument Emily Riehl uses in her book to explain why (C \func D) has limits of shape J whenever D has limits of shape J.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086763):
It turned out to be really gross to formalise.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086772):
(She first explains that (discrete C) \func D has those limits, and then shows that the forgetful functor (C \func D) \func ((discete C) \func D) creates limits.)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086854):
So I've just switched to much more directly constructing limits in (C \func D), and then showing that the evaluation functor ev_X : (C \func D) \func D preserves limits.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:30)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137086861):
This seems to be nice and clean, so I think I'm happy with that for now.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137087044):
Still to do:
1. copy-and-pasting for all the dual notions (I think I'm not ready to make tactics for this yet)
2. quite a bit of cleanup...
3. port a few examples from the old development
4. a few @[simp] lemmas describing how colimit.pre and colimit.desc work in the category of types, which I got confused about...

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 02 2018 at 23:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137087053):
If anyone wants to hack on the `limits-others-new` branch on leanprover-community, feel free. :-)

oh, and 5. I need to try porting the construction of limits from equalizers and products to the new setup.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 03 2018 at 00:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137090585):
Sounds good! I fixed the build by making `auto_cases` work on quotients again and I also made a couple of minor simplifications which you might still be interested in.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 03 2018 at 00:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137090591):
I think I will try to check off a few of the items on my "basic category theory" list, then.

@**Scott Morrison|110087** I'm happy to help out with some of the dualising work. Which parts would I best start to work on?

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 03 2018 at 11:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137107895):
Are certain files pretty stable, and others in flux? Or can I just start anywhere?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 03 2018 at 16:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137116560):
lol, I started looking at the new limits in more detail, and got annoyed by all these `const J C X` with so many explicit arguments, and tried making at least the `C` argument implicit (`X : C`), and immediately got a bunch of errors related to coercions

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 03 2018 at 16:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137116561):
No wonder Scott went on that rant recently :)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 03 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137131371):
That rant got started after I tried making a coercion all the way from `C` to `J \func C`, so you really could just write `X` instead of `const J C X`, as we do in the real world.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 03 2018 at 23:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137131372):
Let's just say it didn't work out. :-)

(deleted a dumb question; I really should check the statement when I'm having trouble proving something....)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 04 2018 at 11:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137151311):
Hi @**Reid Barton**, any chance you'd like to help me with any of the following sorries, on the HEAD of `limits-others-new`:

```
def is_limit.of_extensions_iso (h : is_iso t.extensions) : is_limit t :=
{ lift := Œª s, (inv t.extensions) s.X s.œÄ,
  fac' := begin tidy, sorry, end,
  uniq' := begin tidy, sorry, end }
```

```
def cone.of_representable_cones (F : J ‚•§ C) [r : representable F.cones] : cone F :=
{ X := r.X,
  œÄ := r.w.hom r.X (ùüô r.X) }

def extensions_iso_of_representable_cones (F : J ‚•§ C) [r : representable F.cones] :
  is_iso (cone.of_representable_cones F).extensions :=

{ cone := cone.of_representable_cones F,
  is_limit := is_limit.of_extensions_iso (extensions_iso_of_representable_cones F) }

def cones_representable_of_has_limit (F : J ‚•§ C) [has_limit F] : representable F.cones :=
{ X := (has_limit.cone F).X,

For context, here `F.cones` is the functor `C^op \to Type` so `F.cones X` is the type of natural transformations `X \natt F`, and `t.extensions`, for `t` a cone, is the natural transformation `yoneda C t.X ‚ü∂ F.cones` given by whiskering a cone.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 04 2018 at 11:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137151412):
I'm finding these sorries very confusing. I'm not sure that this is a sign that the design is bad, just that this is a corner of basic category theory that no one ever writes out the details of. :-)

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175002):
I managed to prove them. It took me 2 hours to write about a dozen lines of code.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175591):
Awesome!

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175819):
1. I'm glad it took you a while, it makes me feel less incompetent. :-)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:42)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175821):
2. Is there something we can learn from this having been hard??

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175831):
It seems like a bad sign that something a textbook contents itself with merely stating, was a struggle in the library.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175893):
I also just proved that equalizers are monomorphisms, since that was the other sorry

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175939):
and the lemma I needed to prove it (`is_limit.hom_eq`; maybe not a very good name? but it's hard to think of different names for all the different aspects of the universal property) is something that I used extensively in my homotopy theory library

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175949):
Ah, thanks!

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137175995):
I tend to think of it as a general "extensionality" property for limits, since it generalizes funext/prod.ext

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176009):
It's a close relative of
```
@[extensionality] lemma limit.hom_ext {F : J ‚•§ C} [has_limit F] {X : C}
  {f g : X ‚ü∂ limit F}
  (w : ‚àÄ j, f ‚â´ limit.œÄ F j = g ‚â´ limit.œÄ F j) : f = g :=
```

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176055):
I wonder if we should unify them.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176066):
Oh yeah. Isn't it the same thing?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176067):
I think you should never prove anything about `limit`, always `is_limit`

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176068):
and then provide a wrapper for `limit` if that seems useful

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176108):
because there are lots of ways you could get your hands on a limit cone, only one of which is from the category's chosen limits (if it even has them)

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176114):
I also did this for `is_equalizer.mono`

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176162):
Hmm, I'm on the fence here.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 00:55)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176178):
One can of course, with some hassle, use theorems stated in terms of `limit` in situations where you just have an `is_limit`, by using `is_limit.ext` to prove that your `is_limit` is actually equal to the one `limit` thinks it's using.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:56)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176217):
```quote
2. Is there something we can learn from this having been hard??
```
I wondered about this too. My initial feeling was that there were too many definitions built up (`cones`/`representable`) with too little supporting theory, but upon reflection this didn't really seem to stand up, considering the eventually successful proof was to think hard about the actual fact which was needed, and then have Lean observe that it was enough.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176238):
In lean-homotopy-theory I have many, many applications of facts like "a pushout of a pushout is a pushout" and I work in a setting where the category is not assumed to have pushouts

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 00:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176282):
So that's one obstruction to rewriting things in terms of chosen `limit`s

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176346):
But it is actually also just more practical in general, because it saves you from transporting the relevant facts across an isomorphism, and dealing with isomorphisms is disproportionately difficult in Lean

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176403):
okay --- so the question is: how much of the stuff I currently have written in terms of `limit` should we:
1) remove (for now)
2) rewrite in terms of `is_limit`, possible re-adding wrappers
3) leave as is?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176450):
Well, I suggest 3, with 2 as needed

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176467):
Some things, like "`limit F` is functorial in `F`", really need `limit`

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176649):
Some other things like `limit.pre` and `limit.pre_pre` which involve multiple limit cones are in a sort of middle area. I'm fine with just leaving them how they are until someone wants an `is_limit` version.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:13)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176713):
Oh, I guess I missed that these functions only require limits of the specific diagrams which appear now. That means you can also use them as their `is_limit` equivalents, at least in principle...

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176758):
Still, I don't see any particular advantage to defining, say, `instance : mono (equalizer.Œπ f g)` directly over the way that I did it.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:14)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176763):
I agree there. I think this was my mistake, being over-eager to prove things in the `limit` variation.

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176824):
Now I remember that I actually considered a design like this at one point in lean-homotopy-theory, where you have a specific class `coproduct a b` which provides a chosen coproduct of two specific objects. I never tried it out though

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176827):
I guess my hesitation is that switching to `is_limit` for, for example:
```
def limit.pre (F : J ‚•§ C) [has_limit F] (E : K ‚•§ J) [has_limit (E ‚ãô F)] : limit F ‚ü∂ limit (E ‚ãô F) :=
limit.lift (E ‚ãô F)
{ X := limit F,
  œÄ := { app := Œª k, limit.œÄ F (E k) } }
```
involves more variables.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176833):
The `has_limit` typeclasses each have to turn into a `cone` and an `is_limit`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176836):
A somewhat scary option is to make `is_limit` a typeclass again, and make `has_limit` be inferrable from it...

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176894):
It would be nice if the "typeclass inferred wasn't the one expected" class of errors were all solved by appropriate `subsingleton` instances...

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137176941):
Right, so there are just two differences really: whether or not `cone` and `is_limit` are bundled together, and whether or not the pair is a type class argument

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177013):
Well, `has_limit` is not even a subsingleton, unfortunately :)

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177065):
yeah, so at the moment we're in the upside situation: the typeclass is not a singleton, the non-typeclass is...

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:22)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177066):
yuck! :-)

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177141):
Well anyways, this just makes me even more want to leave all the `limit.*` functions alone (besides `limit.hom_ext` I guess) and just wait and see, in practice, how necessary it is to do "cone-based reasoning" vs "limit-based reasoning", for lack of better terms, and how inconvenient it is to feed the limit cones you want into `limit.*`

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 01:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177222):
okay, great :-)

Hmm, does using `limit.hom_ext` as an `[extensionality]` lemma really work?

#### [ Reid Barton (Nov 05 2018 at 01:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137177398):
I guess it might. I wasn't brave enough to try to make `is_limit.hom_ext` one too, that seems like it would be bad since it would match basically everything.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 05 2018 at 03:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/137180007):
`@[extensionality] lemma limit.hom_ext` seems to work great!

I really need a lot of `coblah` at the moment. Which approach are we going to take? I advocate putting every `costatement` right after `statement`. So the highest level of interleaving that is possible.
I think every other approach will lead to things going hopelessly out of sync.

@**Johan Commelin**, two questions/suggestions:
1) don't you think we should do "easy" sheaves _first_, before the ones with sites and coverages?
2) for your definition `def sieve : presheaf X (Type v) :=`, I think it's much easier if you start off working in tactic mode, and `have` each of the four maps you're building, so that it's easy to inspect their types. Once everything works you can obfuscate everything into term mode if you prefer. :-)

Thanks for the feedback.
1) It might be a good idea. But I really want sheaves on a basis. And a basis is a site... And I think I'm almost there.
2) This sounds like a very good plan!

@**Reid Barton**, @**Johan Commelin**,  I'm close to "sticking a fork in it and saying it's done" on the new limits branch. It's certainly not exhaustively complete, but I want to leave it for a while. Do you think I should re-PR it?

@**Scott Morrison|110087** Would it be an idea to use `coproduct` instead of `limits.sigma`? I think that is just as readable, and less confusing with the existing `sigma`?

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 06 2018 at 11:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/146856807):
I'm open. If we change, we should change `prod` to `binary_product`, `sum` to `binary_coproduct`, `pi` to `product` and `sigma` to `coproduct`.

#### [ Scott Morrison (Nov 06 2018 at 11:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/146856822):

(because it's just the same as the built-in sigma, just for arbitrary categories, not just Type)

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 06 2018 at 11:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/146856886):
Well, we were writing `sigma.map` and it took a while to figure out that we actually wanted `limits.sigma.map`.

Another point, this `sigma.map` could be a bit more general. The domains of `f` and `g` could differ. (In our case we have `c √ó c` and `c`, and they are related via the projections.

@**Kevin Buzzard** So I think we can have sheaves of types on a basis rather soon. Generalising to sheaves of groups/rings shouldn't be hard. (We will need to prove that the respective categories have pullbacks and equalizers and such... but I think that should be doable. If @**Ramon Fernandez Mir** wants, he could also look into that.)
The bigger problem is extending sheaves on a basis to sheaves on the topology. Defining the functor on presheaves is not hard (I already did that a while ago); but proving that it preserves sheaves (it is even an equivalence!) seems to be harder.

#### [ Johan Commelin (Nov 06 2018 at 17:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%202.0/near/146876360):
At least it will be hard if I want to use the general machinery of morphisms of sites.

Most of the proofs stay really close to the level that we as mathematicians would use. Sometimes you have to go into gory details, which means we didn't set up enough rules for `obviously`. But that should be easy to improve.

If you want to avoid `by exactI` tricks then you could probably define the limits of `X` in a separate top-level definition, taking care to put the arguments in the correct order for `has_limits`, and also to put the `[small_category J]` bit to the left of the colon

@**Scott Morrison|110087** I saw that in the stuff on over categories you added `right := punit.star` a couple of times. Why is this necessary? I thought `obviously` was handling it.

@**Johan Commelin**, regarding `right := punit.star`. I did remove this, but I think only temporarily. The problem is that every field with an `autoparam` should be restated, otherwise the auto_param garbage clutters up the goal view, and sometimes gets in the way of elaboration.  I want to restore `obviously` to `left` and `right`, but it will involve restating `hom` by hand, and I didn't want to do that on the spot.

Because now I have a bunch of code containing `X.fst` which will probably have to be written as the defeq `ffst.obj X` just to make sure that it plays nice with later constructions.

The problem with classes is that the `.func_in_namespace` syntax doesn't work. So while you can add a specific function (like `fst`) `map` needs to be named `fmap` or we need to introduce a infix operator. Similar with the theorem names.

Note that the example `pi.post` where things start to go wrong is again a *definition*. That means it will appear in the statement of theorems about limits. It will not be possible to specialize these theorems to facts about `pi.post` if the latter is defined in a way unrelated to `limit.post`.

In my mind M and especially N are not fixed, but variable. So it's not just a matter of "write out all the N*M things, and then you're done"

A cocone on F is a natural transformation from F : J \func C to a constant functor X. Whiskering means whiskering this natural transformation by a functor (i.e. horizontal composition with the identity natural transformation on a functor) (but we still need to work out if we mean by a functor J' \func J or by a functor C \func C'). Looking up `category_theory/limits/cones.lean`, it seems we have `def whisker {K : Type v} [small_category K] (E : K ‚•§ J) (c : cocone F) : cocone (E ‚ãô F)`,  so it's whiskering on the left.
