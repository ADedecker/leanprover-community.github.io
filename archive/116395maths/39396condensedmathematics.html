<p>I mentioned a link to a talk of Scholze on condensed sets recently. He's giving a course on it now:</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf">a direct link to the pdf notes</a>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> if you want to find a use for your categories other than "doing schemes properly" -- can you do this? This all looks very very reasonable to do in Lean, and it is a Fields Medallist explaining some completely up to the minute ideas. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> can you make anything of this? Scholze is wresting with some very general ideas about how mathematicians put topology in their work, but of course he is coming from a very algebraic perspective. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> after exams do you want to take a look at this? This might be a big thing, and in stark contrast to the perfectoid space theory, the entireity of what is known to humanity about condensed mathematics is in those 33 pages. Seems like a great time to start formalising it!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Theorem 1.10. The category of condensed abelian groups is an abelian category which satis-
fies Grothendieckâ€™s axioms (AB3), (AB4), (AB5), (AB6), (AB3*) and (AB4*), to wit: all limits
(AB3*) and colimits (AB3) exist, arbitrary products (AB4*), arbitrary direct sums (AB4) and fil-
tered colimits (AB5) are exact,...
</pre></div>


<p>The proof looks simple. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> how far are we from formalising this stuff in Lean?</p>

<p>Proof is in lecture 2.</p>

<p>Scholze seems to be worrying about the kind of things you once told me you were worrying about (cutting off the universe at kappa and then worrying about what he's lost)</p>

<p>Tom and I were actually discussing this as a possible project last week. I guess it depends on the API for sheaves on sites. Do we have a definition of what it means for a Grothendieck topology to be generated by covering families, and can we work with sheaves on sites other than the opens of a topological space? Do we have the category of pro-objects of finsets, or at least Stone spaces? If that's all there, then the various categories of condensed (insert models of algebraic theory) should be straightforward to define.</p>

<p>I know that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> was thinking about Grothendieck topologies at some point but he ran into problems. Johan -- why did you stop doing sheaves on sites? Would working in one fixed universe help matters? Note that Scholze spends half his life justifying how he can do everything in <code>Type 0</code>.</p>
