<p>Right now, the identity does not make sense as a linear map from <code>ℕ</code> to <code>ℕ</code> as <code>ℕ</code> is not a ring, only a semiring. Would anyone object to defining linear maps on semimodules over semirings to allow "linear algebra" on <code>ℕ</code>-valued matrices? This shows up on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1883" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1883">#1883</a>, where it is rightly argued that having the trace of an <code>ℕ</code>-valued matrix makes sense, and still I think it would be better to have the trace as a linear map.</p>

<p>I don't think there's even a change to the axioms, so this definitely makes sense.</p>
