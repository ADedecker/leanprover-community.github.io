<p>Has anyone made an attempt at defining the category of R-modules, now that the module refactor has landed?</p>

<p>No, but I think we should. And then we should define a monoidal structure on it (maybe on a branch of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128547">@Michael Jendrusch</span>'s repo). I think that would be a very good test case for the new modules, the tensor product, and monoidal categories.</p>
