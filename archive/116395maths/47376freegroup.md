<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> You can do such "arguments by cardinality" for universe resizing in lean as well. An example of this is:</p>

<p>that just says that the reduced word is smaller than the input</p>

<p>I mean if v ~~ w then length (reduce w) &lt;= length v</p>

<p>oh, I don't know that then</p>

<p>You may find <a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems154.html" target="_blank" title="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems154.html">http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems154.html</a> helpful; that's my construction of free groups in metamath by a similar method (it's more cumbersome in ZFC since it has to describe the whole reduction sequence, not just the result)</p>

<p>I think I see the proof strategy. It goes by induction on the length of an extension sequence, proving that if two extension sequences (where one has length &lt;= n) end at the same point, then they start at the same point</p>

<p>I thought you wrote it</p>

<p>I'm rereading the proof now</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 02 2018 at 06:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/free%20group/near/124512530):
<p>An extension sequence is a sequence that starts at a reduced word and inserts cancelling pairs one at a time</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 02 2018 at 06:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/free%20group/near/124512533):
<p>and the first step in the proof shows that every word has an extension sequence that terminates with it</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 02 2018 at 06:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/free%20group/near/124512626):
<p>Since the length of an extension sequence is also (half) the difference in length between the initial word and the reduced word, you could try induction on that</p>

<p>Okay, here's a suggestion in your language: can you prove the following?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inductive red (IT : Type u) [inv_type IT] :

| cancel : â a x, red (a :: aâ»Â¹ :: x) x

theorem eqv_gen_red (IT : Type u) [inv_type IT]

<p>this will considerably simplify your induction for the <code>reduce.exact</code> theorem</p>

#### [ Kenny Lau (Apr 02 2018 at 06:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/free%20group/near/124513023):
<p>but I don't need to simply <code>reduced.sound</code>, I need to prove <code>reduced.exact</code></p>

<p>yeah that</p>

<p>You could also fold in the eqv_gen constructors into the constructors of <code>red</code> if you prefer</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Apr 02 2018 at 06:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/free%20group/near/124513077):
<p>although splitting it this way gives you the ability to talk about one step reduction</p>

<p>(You could also do the left and right multiplications as separate lemmas)</p>
