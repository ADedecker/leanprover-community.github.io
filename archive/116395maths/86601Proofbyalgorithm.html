<p>Rumor has it that an algorithm is a valid proof. Is there an example of an algorithmic proof in Lean?</p>

<p>Tactics are algorithmic proofs. I would guess that <code>norm_num</code>, <code>ring</code>, <code>linarith</code> and <code>omega</code> are all good examples of proof-by-algorithm</p>

<p>I don't either, actually. But I have heard many times that "Programs are proofs" and "Constructive Proofs are programs" by Curry Howard. I can "sort-of, maybe, sometimes (SMS) " agree with constructive proofs being programs, under a lot of assumptions. But "programs are proofs" is a direction that I'm "sort-of, maybe, sometimes" wresting with. I have many working GCD algorithms (e.g. NAT, POlYNOMIALS, etc.) and I'm trying to prove them "correct". That is, I'm trying to prove that they fulfill a specification. The specification is "sort-of, maybe, sometimes" a set of logical definitions and axioms, (e.g. gcd(x,y) == gcd(y,x) )</p>
<p>The language of the program (in this case, lisp) is irrelevant since it should be possible to translate a proof into a lambda form expressible in lisp. Given that the lambda form came from a proof with its associated definitions and axioms, it should be possible to "prove" the lambda form, that is, to prove the program.</p>
<p>So the fundamental tasks are to (1) turn a gcd proof into a program and (2) to turn the program into a gcd proof. I am pondering a way to take the lowest level Lean output format into lisp.</p>
<p>Given that this is research (aka creative reuse :-) ) I was hoping for working examples to SMS reasoning.</p>
<p>The other working assumption is that I'm just confused but that's more of an axiom than an assumption.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to tell you that by the Curry Howard isomorphism, the only thing you learn proof-wise from the existence of an algorithm in lisp is that the type of lisp s-expressions is inhabited</p>

<p>In order to get anything nontrivial out of curry howard, you need a really strong type system</p>

<p>So a constructive proof is only evidence that the type is inhabited? Then what does it mean to "generate program" from ITP?</p>

<p>well, they sort of do, but you have to run the program to obtain a proof, and you only get a proof for that particular input</p>

<p>you might operate <em>on</em> symbolic expressions, but to prove facts about the program that is doing the manipulation you need to work a meta level above that</p>
