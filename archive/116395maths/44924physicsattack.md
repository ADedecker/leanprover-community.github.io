Argg, mathlib is under attack from the physics department!

I wasn't expecting that

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230387):
I know Mario doesn't want to have folders `cs` and `math` as the first level of the mathlib file hierarchy, but maybe we could have a `physics` folder

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 19 2018 at 15:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230503):
Is this referring to the `tensor` PR :lol: ?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230509):
Sure

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230517):
it's `physics_tensor`, there is a typo

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230596):
It's very interesting however that someone outside CS seemed to have been able to learn Lean without coming here on Zulip

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 19 2018 at 15:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134230939):
And it is using `tidy`! Is this a student of Scott, maybe?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231019):
The plot thickens

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 19 2018 at 15:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231277):
@**Simon Hudon** How much of the tensor PR can be done using `pi_instances`?

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 19 2018 at 15:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231512):
Alex Bentkamp (benti @ github) is a CS PhD student here at the VU. So this is not related to physics. And he got help from me and Rob (his office mate)

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231521):
What about acting stupid and answering we already have tensor products of modules by Kenny?

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 19 2018 at 15:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231530):
why do we need matrices if we have modules?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231533):
Wow

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 19 2018 at 15:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231754):
its based on the Deep_Learning entry in the AFP: https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Deep_Learning/Tensor.html

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:26)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231834):
So today I learned CS people use the word tensor in the same way physicists do

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231851):
Too bad, I was impressed by the story of a physicist learning Lean alone

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231868):
Still, we have matrices but we don't call them linear maps, we call them matrices

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:28)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134231928):
So we need a different name for tensors and this physics/IA stuff

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 19 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232125):
IA? is this french for artificial intelligence?

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232136):
sorry, I probably meant AI

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232155):
Yes, wikipedia says AI

#### [ Johan Commelin (Sep 19 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232158):
IA = irtificial antelligence

#### [ Johannes Hölzl (Sep 19 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232172):
 @**Patrick Massot**  can you mention the renaming concern on the PR? Alex is usually not here on Zulip

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232174):
yes, it's computer imitating ants who are stupid but exhibit collective intelligence

#### [ Patrick Massot (Sep 19 2018 at 15:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/physics%20attack/near/134232462):
