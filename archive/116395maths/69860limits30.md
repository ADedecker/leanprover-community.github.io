<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> Any updates on special shapes? I would love to have (co)equalizers and pullbacks/pushouts. I could try to come up with something myself, but I think I won't get a better interface than what we had before.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499328):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I split up what I'd done before into <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-shapes" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-shapes">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-shapes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-other" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-other">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-other</a>.</p>

<p>The first just has a minimal API for (de)constructing cones corresponding to each of the usual special shapes. It seems like this part, or at least some version of it, is necessary no matter what we do later, and I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> agrees.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499346):
<p>The second is just my original work on the <code>O(M*N)</code> api, rebased onto the <code>limits-shapes</code> branch.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499390):
<p>I would still be perfectly happy to work on getting that merged, but Reid wasn't too happy with it. I've been in holiday mode for a while (...maybe too long... :-) and now really better turn to grant-writing-mode, but if you want to discuss this I'm happy to make changes.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 06 2019 at 06:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154501854):
<p>I see. You didn't PR the <code>limits-shapes</code> branch yet, did you?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 14 2019 at 10:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/155072768):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> What's your opinion on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/a55e2334379c4769220e9446068bac89ddb6f29a" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/a55e2334379c4769220e9446068bac89ddb6f29a">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/a55e2334379c4769220e9446068bac89ddb6f29a</a>? I think this is <code>O(N)</code> stuff that we will want anyway. Should it be PR'd?</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 17 2019 at 16:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/155345833):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>  I'm just wondering, wouldn't it be "better" if <code>is_limit.lift</code> was a cone morphism, instead of just a hom between the tips?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411010):
<p>I went back and forth on this a few times. Mario's suggestion had been that for the most basic definitions, it was good to write things out explicitly.</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411078):
<p>I would not complain about switching this again. Can you point to places where it would essentially simplify use?</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411125):
<p>I should PR the <code>limits-shapes</code> branch, I guess. I haven't had much Lean time recently -- but if, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> , you think it looks plausible, I will hit the PR button soon.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 07:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156423791):
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> I personally think it looks fine. So let's just go for it...</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156429529):
<p>Unrelated question: should <code>is_colimit.mk_cocone_morphism</code> be renamed to <code>is_colimit.mk_of_cocone_morphism</code>?<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> This is an example where I am using <code>unique</code>: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/adjunctions-2/src/category_theory/adjunction.lean#L321" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/adjunctions-2/src/category_theory/adjunction.lean#L321">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/adjunctions-2/src/category_theory/adjunction.lean#L321</a></p>

<p>The proof is somewhat annoying with a <code>letI</code> that shouldn't be there.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430366):
<p>That is probably because I didn't listen well enough to Mario, and made <code>equiv.unique_of_equiv</code> use instances, instead of explicit variables.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430367):
<p>that</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430368):
<p>However, this proof captures very well the spirit of the maths proof.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430420):
<p>Right, so I'll improve it by fixing <code>equiv.unique_of_equiv</code></p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430425):
<p>And the proof would become even slicker if I don't have to call <code>is_colimit_iso_unique_cocone_morphism</code> two times.</p>

#### [ Mario Carneiro (Jan 19 2019 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430432):
<p>feel free to smuggle the change in your next category theory PR</p>

#### [ Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156432390):
<p>Ok, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/611" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/611">#611</a> contains <code>limits-shapes</code>.</p>
