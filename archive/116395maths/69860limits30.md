@**Scott Morrison|110087** @**Reid Barton** Any updates on special shapes? I would love to have (co)equalizers and pullbacks/pushouts. I could try to come up with something myself, but I think I won't get a better interface than what we had before.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:02)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499328):
@**Johan Commelin** I split up what I'd done before into https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-shapes and https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/limits-other.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499344):
The first just has a minimal API for (de)constructing cones corresponding to each of the usual special shapes. It seems like this part, or at least some version of it, is necessary no matter what we do later, and I think @**Reid Barton** agrees.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499346):
The second is just my original work on the `O(M*N)` api, rebased onto the `limits-shapes` branch.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 06 2019 at 05:04)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154499390):
I would still be perfectly happy to work on getting that merged, but Reid wasn't too happy with it. I've been in holiday mode for a while (...maybe too long... :-) and now really better turn to grant-writing-mode, but if you want to discuss this I'm happy to make changes.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 06 2019 at 06:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/154501854):
I see. You didn't PR the `limits-shapes` branch yet, did you?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 14 2019 at 10:43)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/155072768):
@**Reid Barton** What's your opinion on https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/a55e2334379c4769220e9446068bac89ddb6f29a? I think this is `O(N)` stuff that we will want anyway. Should it be PR'd?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 17 2019 at 16:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/155345833):
@**Scott Morrison|110087** @**Reid Barton**  I'm just wondering, wouldn't it be "better" if `is_limit.lift` was a cone morphism, instead of just a hom between the tips?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:23)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411010):
I went back and forth on this a few times. Mario's suggestion had been that for the most basic definitions, it was good to write things out explicitly.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:24)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411078):
I would not complain about switching this again. Can you point to places where it would essentially simplify use?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 01:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156411125):
I should PR the `limits-shapes` branch, I guess. I haven't had much Lean time recently -- but if, @**Johan Commelin** , you think it looks plausible, I will hit the PR button soon.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 07:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156423791):
@**Scott Morrison|110087** I personally think it looks fine. So let's just go for it...

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156429529):
Unrelated question: should `is_colimit.mk_cocone_morphism` be renamed to `is_colimit.mk_of_cocone_morphism`?

@**Scott Morrison|110087** @**Mario Carneiro** This is an example where I am using `unique`: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/adjunctions-2/src/category_theory/adjunction.lean#L321

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:48)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430354):
The proof is somewhat annoying with a `letI` that shouldn't be there.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430366):
That is probably because I didn't listen well enough to Mario, and made `equiv.unique_of_equiv` use instances, instead of explicit variables.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430367):
that

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:49)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430368):
However, this proof captures very well the spirit of the maths proof.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430420):
Right, so I'll improve it by fixing `equiv.unique_of_equiv`

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Johan Commelin (Jan 19 2019 at 10:50)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430425):
And the proof would become even slicker if I don't have to call `is_colimit_iso_unique_cocone_morphism` two times.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Mario Carneiro (Jan 19 2019 at 10:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156430432):
feel free to smuggle the change in your next category theory PR

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Scott Morrison (Jan 19 2019 at 11:45)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/limits%203.0/near/156432390):
Ok, #611 contains `limits-shapes`.
