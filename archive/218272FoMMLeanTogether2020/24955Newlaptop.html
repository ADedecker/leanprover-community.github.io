<p>The bad news is that I had a minor mishap yesterday which resulted in my laptop getting completely borked. I am hoping to buy a new one at Target when it opens at 8am.  The good news is that that creates an opportunity to observe/debug/improve the process of installing Lean on a Windows machine. Let me know if you're interested in that. I certainly want to get it done today.</p>
