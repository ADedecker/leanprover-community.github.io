<p>Every IMO typically features one or two geometry problems. These might be a relatively easy target for AI. One can attack them using Gröbner bases, or decidability for real closed fields. Both algorithms are expensive, but they have been implemented before. I think Maple and Mathematica can solve a whole bunch of these problems, and versions of these have also been implemented in Coq.</p>

<p>I have no idea if they have ever been systematically "tested" against a database of IMO level geometry problems.</p>
