<p>PDF files with the IMO problems are available here: <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx" target="_blank" title="https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx">https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx</a></p>
<p>Does anyone know whether there is a LaTeX version of these files available? Could we ask IMO for such files?</p>

<p>I’ve never done IMO stuff, so I’m not an expert, but I see there are a lot of problems here in a wiki format (which I assume uses some pseudo LaTeX).  <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3222_imo" target="_blank" title="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3222_imo">https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3222_imo</a></p>

<p>Aha... that's already a start. I don't see a mass download button though...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  I think if this is a serious research project, which it seems to be, it is worth talking to a number of people about the best sources of official problem sets and training problem sets and what formats they come in.  Some ideas include talking to the IMO folks, the admins for the Art of Problem Solving, the team leads for various countries (Po Shen Lo is at CMU for instance), previous Olympians like Reid, and maybe the MathOverflow/MathSciNet community.  It would be good to talk to them about the official IMO problems, but also about other canonical sets of practice problems at various levels of difficulty.  It is always good to have lots of training and test data, especially if machine learning is involved.  AOPS or the IMO committee might like the press of partnering with Microsoft Research to train computers to solve challenging math problems.  (Or a different spin: "computers can't come even close to the most talented high school students".)  I could also imagine a large dump of a website like AOPS involving copyright and data sharing issues that need to be worked out.  Also, once the data is procured, there are questions about how to start to organize and process it.  (To be clear, I am sure Daniel Selsam and team are carefully thinking through all this, and I don't mean to suggest otherwise.)</p>
