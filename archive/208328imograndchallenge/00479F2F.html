<p>To eliminate the need for human judges, we propose the formal-to-formal (F2F) variant of the IMO: the AI receives a formal representation of the problem (in the Lean Theorem Prover), and is required to emit a formal (i.e. machine-checkable) proof.

<p>Doesn't this mean that human "judges" will not be able to say why they should trust Lean's solution, and why it deserves a gold medal?</p>

<p>I guess the IMO judges won't like this "eliminate the need for human judges". I'm sure you can explain the idea using a less aggressive phrasing. When talking to colleagues about formal maths, I've noticed there are always some people who feel threatened and react defensively. I think they shouldn't feel like this, but most mathematicians are still human beings, so they don't always act rationnaly...</p>

<p>Yes, I think the motivation is set up in a confusing way.  This is more of a computer IMO instead of a computer-judged IMO.  As an analogy, think computer go/chess/bridge.  The key is not that you are replacing the original IMO competition with computer judges, but making a computer variant which naturally is judged by a computer proof checker.</p>

<p>When I first read the webpage, I thought this was humans (probably not high school students) writing proofs in Lean.  It took me another read to realize it was computers writing proofs in Lean.  (But this might have just been based on my having seen others here talk about solving IMO problems in Lean.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> Hi Johan. First, I'll say that the rules are very much up for debate. The current proposal reflects two competing desiderata. On one hand, we want people to agree on the scoring system ahead of time, and we fear that it might be hard to preempt post-test controversy if we rely on human judges instead of the Lean kernel. On the other hand, we want to honor the spirit of the (traditional) IMO and only accept high-level proofs. If it happened that a fancy decision procedure could get Gold on the IMO with incomprehensible low-level proofs, I would probably consider that more a quirk of the test than progress in AI. The current rules allow lower-level proofs than humans could possibly provide, but type-checking in 10 minutes given only the acceptable background math does limit how low-level a proof can be. If a team wanted their AI to use e.g. Sturm sequences, the proofs they submit would need to include formally verified versions of all relevant claims, all of which must be type-checkable within the 10 minute time limit. To some extent we can enforce higher level proofs even in the F2F setting by just decreasing the amount of time allowed for type-checking.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> Thanks for mentioning this. It never occurred to me. I will think about how to clarify the motivations. Also, see discussion a few posts up about whether we even want machine-checkable proofs.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> Hi Jason. Funny, this interpretation never occurred to me. I will add a sentence to preempt it.</p>

<p>Presumably the intention is that solutions can use mathlib; is compiling the needed parts of mathlib included in the 10 minutes? (That seems like a terrible interpretation to me.)</p>
