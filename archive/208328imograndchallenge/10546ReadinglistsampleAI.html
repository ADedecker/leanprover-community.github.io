<p>Hi, I was wondering: are there any plans to have a reading list or sample AI for the competition?  I ask as somebody interested in following this and understand what approaches work well, but without the capacity to build a team/compete in it.</p>

<p>Wait, I always interpreted "competion" as 1 AI team against all the human competitors. I'd rather bundle forces than have multiple AI teams competing against each other and not sharing ideas etc etc</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span> A reading list would be difficult now, since there is no consensus on what existing paradigms might even help. Hopefully there will be enough experiments and incremental progress over time that we can build a useful reading list out of future papers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> The first stage of the project---to establish that the problems and solutions can indeed be formalized, to build a dataset of problems for training and validation, and to establish the rules for what constitute winning---is 100% a community effort. It might even be nice for us all to work towards a community paper introducing the grand challenge and the dataset of historical problems.  On the other hand, it is too early to foresee how the AI research itself will play out. There may be many pairwise-unrelated approaches of differing scale taken by different groups of people at different times.</p>
