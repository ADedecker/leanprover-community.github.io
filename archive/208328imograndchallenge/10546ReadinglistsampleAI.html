<p>Hi, I was wondering: are there any plans to have a reading list or sample AI for the competition?  I ask as somebody interested in following this and understand what approaches work well, but without the capacity to build a team/compete in it.</p>

<p>Wait, I always interpreted "competion" as 1 AI team against all the human competitors. I'd rather bundle forces than have multiple AI teams competing against each other and not sharing ideas etc etc</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span> A reading list would be difficult now, since there is no consensus on what existing paradigms might even help. Hopefully there will be enough experiments and incremental progress over time that we can build a useful reading list out of future papers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> The first stage of the project---to establish that the problems and solutions can indeed be formalized, to build a dataset of problems for training and validation, and to establish the rules for what constitute winning---is 100% a community effort. It might even be nice for us all to work towards a community paper introducing the grand challenge and the dataset of historical problems.  On the other hand, it is too early to foresee how the AI research itself will play out. There may be many pairwise-unrelated approaches of differing scale taken by different groups of people at different times.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> I think I was mostly looking at reading list for motivation, i.e., what has motivated you or other organizers that this is achievable?    After looking at a few of the IMO problems, competing in the IMO seems much harder to me than the Aristo/Project Halo goals, and they weren't expecting formal proofs in the answers to questions.</p>

<p>Is the IMO challenge focus only on making a environment + data set using lean for ML using IMO problems or does also provide a lean environment for ML research/applications etc?</p>
<p>I am curious to learn to what extent lean can be used for ML. Is such a thing possible and how easy is it to do it in Lean?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246156">@Brando Miranda</span> The goal is to spur fundamental progress in computer science, and to eventually build an AI that can win gold. Different people involved have different thoughts about the role that ML will play in this endeavor. I believe that ML may be able to help a lot. I plan to wrap existing frameworks in Lean and to deeply integrate ML into the Lean tactic language, but the exact interfaces and abstractions are yet to be determined.</p>

<p>Can you clarify what that means? Even if its vaguely? Does that mean one can access and use Pytorch Tensorflow using Lean itself or accessing Lean from within Python (the universal ML language)?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To clarify: I have no current plans to write a TF/PyTorch frontend in Lean. There are many options for how to connect Lean to a trained network at runtime. In prior work I used gRPC (e.g. in <a href="https://github.com/dselsam/neurocore-public" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/dselsam/neurocore-public">https://github.com/dselsam/neurocore-public</a>), but it is also possible to wrap relevant parts of Lean in Python (<a href="https://github.com/dselsam/lean-python-bindings" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/dselsam/lean-python-bindings">https://github.com/dselsam/lean-python-bindings</a> bit-rot but something like it could be resurrected), or to wrap C++/Python in Lean (e.g. in <a href="https://github.com/dselsam/certigrad" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/dselsam/certigrad">https://github.com/dselsam/certigrad</a>). For me the pressing conceptual challenge is how to let users write high-level tactics that induce intractable search spaces, and how to have the system train models to guide those tactics as conveniently and generically as possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>why is that the goal? Perhaps my intuition is different. Why would we want intractable tactic spaces? Why do we want the system to train conventionally or generically? Should the goal be tractable spaces that achieve the goal we want (i.e. solve the maths problems)? Or perhaps I misunderstood something.</p>
