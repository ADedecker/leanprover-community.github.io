<p>I have heard about the area method too but I don't know how powerful it really is. As far as I know it is a generalization of perhaps the nicest proof  of Ceva's theorem (using areas).<br>
An issue of it may lie in the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The area method is used for proving constructive geometry conjectures: statements about properties of objects constructed by some fixed set of elementary constructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(see page 10 of the referred paper: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf</a>)<br>
If you look at the statements of IMO geometry problems, they are rarely of the form "there is a construction X, proof property Y", more often they are of the form "there is a construction X, prove that if property Y holds, then property Z holds." And even if they are of the first form, would they fit to the constructions and properties that area method uses?<br>
Generally, I don't believe that there is any human-feasible method that would solve by itself a large portion of IMO geometry problems. The IMO jury should be trying to prevent it. If IMO geometry problems are solvable by a computer (I believe it could be the case), it should require large computations.</p>

<p>Maybe this conversation should move to another Zulip thread. That one is meant to be used by the Zulip AI only. More seriously, it would make it easier to find back this conversation. Miroslav, I think you can to the move by editing your first message in this thread.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I am most curious about which (non-synthetic) decision procedures work for which existing problems, e.g. by considering them as nonlinear real arithmetic (NRA) problems.</p>

<p>One thing I find interesting about the windmill problem seems interesting in that the IMO problem talks about a line "rotating" about a pivot.  This suggests a temporal component, and perhaps the radial velocity should be part of the definition of a "windmill".  For this problem though it doesn't matter, and instead the only thing that is relevant is the step function between pivot points.<br>
Also given that the IMO problem is about an arbitrary collection of points, I don't see how current geometric approaches would be able to solve the general problem, but perhaps they could solve specific instances.</p>

<p>I had several remarks, only one of them is related to geometry (and I don't consider the Windmill problem related to geometry, it is rather combinatorics).</p>

<p>By the way, the comments teaching me how to use Zulip look irrelevant from the general perspective. I suggest using rather private messages next time. By the way, can I delete at least my comments of this topic?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I'm very sorry my message may have sounded a bit aggressive. I'm sure Daniel and the whole grand-challenge team is very happy to read your contributions. Experience on this forum suggests things are a bit easier if we somehow try to separate topics, but there are plenty of counterexamples. So please don't let that issue prevent you from contributing.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> I am trying to understand the specifications we are trying to pin down in this community. Inspired by a question on the Intermediate Langauge stream referencing HOList and worrying about portability of the competition if things get tied down to lean, is the goal of the project also to re-implement something like HOList? How is it going to be different? </p>
<p>From the comment on that thread/stream it seems that re-implementing HOList would be a pain (I wish I understood why), but I think it would be important to understand the difference and planning things out before going out and re-implementing a complicated system like HOList. What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>It is not hard to interface with ML systems. Lean has a tactic framework, with excellent meta-programming support, and also a foreign function interface.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246156">@Brando Miranda</span> I can try to address (narrowly) what I think would need to happen to reimplement HOList in Lean.  I know at least one person here is working on it.  I don’t know what progress they have made.  I’m probably the one who said this  a “pain”.  I should probably backtrack and say it is doable with a good amount of engineering work, and I hope someone builds it!  As I think you have an ML background, I won’t try to cover up the ML terminology.</p>

<p>As I see it, the HOList projects have the following parts that would need to be reimplemented:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A list of theorems</em> For both training and testing, one needs a list of theorems (and the full context in some nicely parsable form) to train on.</li>
<li><em>Proof recording (optional)</em> If one wants to do supervised learning, then one needs a list of proofs as well to train on.  These proofs will contain the theorem to prove (with the context) as well as the various tactics which have been applied along with their arguments.  This needs to be at some intermediate level which records the name of the tactic and the arguments (so at a higher level than type theory), but probably not at the level of the raw lean code.  I’ve heard from some in the Lean community that the tactic environment could be hacked to provide this information, but I don’t know that it has ever been done.  HOL Light has some advantages here.  It has a simpler tactic framework (I think), it is a larger library (more training data), it is written by one person mostly (so is more uniform), and HOL Light only uses tactics (whereas Lean uses a mixture of tactics and the type theoretic framework).  However, the ASTactic (CogGym) and ProverBot9001 projects also used proof recording for Coq.</li>
<li><em>An interactive environment</em> If one wants to do reinforcement learning and/or tree search, one needs to be able to quickly interact with the system.  For tree search, given a particular state, one needs to be able to try possible tactics, see what the results are and back track if needed (using for example beam search).  Also, for reinforcement learning, one needs to be able to try out a very large number of scenarios (in this case theorems, either real or synthetic, to prove).  This necessitates an even faster back-and-forth between the agent and the system.  Google rewrote HOL Light in C++ for this purpose.  (The various Coq ML projects don’t use reinforcement learning.)</li>
<li><em>A system for scoring tactics and tactic arguments</em>  Scoring the tactics can be done as a probability distribution over the tactics (computed by a neural network), but scoring the arguments to these tactics can be a bit more tricky because of the large number of possibilities.  HOList has one system for doing this.  The two Coq projects have another system.  I don’t know if either is readily adaptable to Lean.</li>
<li><em>Access to neural networks and computer power for training and evaluation</em> The agent will have to compute tactic and argument scores via (graph?) neural networks.  Therefore, it needs access to TensorFlow or PyTorch and a distributed computing system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some further comments.  One doesn’t need proof recording.  Instead one can train solely with theorem statements and reinforcement learning.  Conversely, if one doesn’t use reinforcement learning, then one doesn’t need as much speed in the interactive environment.  Also, the tree search agent could live inside Lean (as a tactic) making FFI calls to TensorFlow, say.  Alternately it could have the agent in Python or C++.  Then it would have to guide Lean from the outside.  I don’t know which is better.</p>
