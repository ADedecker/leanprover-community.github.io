<p>I have heard about the area method too but I don't know how powerful it really is. As far as I know it is a generalization of perhaps the nicest proof  of Ceva's theorem (using areas).<br>
An issue of it may lie in the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The area method is used for proving constructive geometry conjectures: statements about properties of objects constructed by some fixed set of elementary constructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(see page 10 of the referred paper: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00426563/PDF/areaMethodRecapV2.pdf</a>)<br>
If you look at the statements of IMO geometry problems, they are rarely of the form "there is a construction X, proof property Y", more often they are of the form "there is a construction X, prove that if property Y holds, then property Z holds." And even if they are of the first form, would they fit to the constructions and properties that area method uses?<br>
Generally, I don't believe that there is any human-feasible method that would solve by itself a large portion of IMO geometry problems. The IMO jury should be trying to prevent it. If IMO geometry problems are solvable by a computer (I believe it could be the case), it should require large computations.</p>

<p>Maybe this conversation should move to another Zulip thread. That one is meant to be used by the Zulip AI only. More seriously, it would make it easier to find back this conversation. Miroslav, I think you can to the move by editing your first message in this thread.</p>

<p>Now it is "hmble", any suggestion for a better name? (why does it actually require a name, I just wanted to contribute to the general discussion)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I am most curious about which (non-synthetic) decision procedures work for which existing problems, e.g. by considering them as nonlinear real arithmetic (NRA) problems.</p>

<p>One thing I find interesting about the windmill problem seems interesting in that the IMO problem talks about a line "rotating" about a pivot.  This suggests a temporal component, and perhaps the radial velocity should be part of the definition of a "windmill".  For this problem though it doesn't matter, and instead the only thing that is relevant is the step function between pivot points.<br>
Also given that the IMO problem is about an arbitrary collection of points, I don't see how current geometric approaches would be able to solve the general problem, but perhaps they could solve specific instances.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm not reading carefully enough, but I was under the impression there was a clear geometry thread. If this is not specific enough then it means we give up using Zulip threads.</p>

<p>I had several remarks, only one of them is related to geometry (and I don't consider the Windmill problem related to geometry, it is rather combinatorics).</p>

<p>By the way, the comments teaching me how to use Zulip look irrelevant from the general perspective. I suggest using rather private messages next time. By the way, can I delete at least my comments of this topic?</p>
