<p>I assume one of the first steps is to translate all or most of the existing IMO problems into Lean.  I wonder if it would be better to translate them into a separate IMO-specific intermediate language first.  The are many reasons for this.  The most important is that it will make this set of problems available to a much wider community of researchers who work in other systems or logics.  Even if the <em>official</em> competition is in Lean, we all want to know how the state of the art in ATP, ITP tactics, and AI systems fair on IMO problems.  And it seems easier to parse a special intermediate language than to parse arbitrary Lean code (or worse to rebuild a complicated system like HOList or an ATP-backed hammer in Lean).</p>

<p>Developing such a language seems like a research project in itself. Are there viable existing candidates, for which translating from them into Lean is easier than translating directly?</p>
