<li>Geometry<br>
This is actually a field that I proposed to start with on AITP 2018. As far as I know, the computational methods (Wu's method / Gröbner basis / ...) are stronger than any synthetic approach, and I have heard that they are capable of solving at least some of the IMO problems. On the other hand, the computational methods cannot be generalized for other fields which is why I am not so much interested in them, and I prefer synthetic ones. I believe that the geometrical problems are the easiest ones even using the synthetic approach only.</li>

<li>Other domains.<br>
It is well known that IMO problems are of four categories: "Geometry / Algebra / Number Theory / Combinatorics" (a friend of mine once came with a nice comparison to "Imagination / Computation / Knowledge / Thinking" :-) ). The problem statements are relatively monotonous inside a single domain unless there is a combinatorial flavour. The most difficult problems from both formalisation perspective and the problem solving perspective are imho problems from Combinatorial Geometry. I am for example curious about the formalisation of the windmill problem (2011-2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM</a>).</li>

<li>Folklore problems<br>
I recieved a set of "folklore problems" from another friend of mine who is also involved in the IMO. They are well known puzzles easier than IMO but in a similar language. Some of them are perhaps too easy to calculate, some may be even challenging to formulate, some are of the type that I really doubt that the current automation tools could solve them. Perhaps other people here have other favourite basic mathematical puzzle problems. Should I share the list (I would have to translate it to English first)? Are we interested in formalizing olympiad-like mathematical puzzles not necessarily coming from IMO?</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not concerned that formalizing the problem statement, or formalizing the solution would be impossible, I just find it somewhat challenging, so I would like to see it. Of course, if an automated system (not designed to solving this particular problem) could find a solution to it, I would be super-impressed. However, I feel the following issue of the formalization of the problem statement. There are some facts about the problem that are so obvious (but really nontrivial to formally proof) that it is unclear whether they are actually a part of the problem statement, or a part of the solution. I mean for example "given any initial line, there is exactly one windmill process".</p>

<p>It makes sense. Note that although there is no public document for the IMO marking scheme, the judges prepare it and agree on the marking scheme before checking the solutions.</p>

<p>Sure:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>triangle(A,B,C)
M = midpoint(A,C)
circle(w)
B on w
M on w
P = intersection(w, segment(A,B))
Q = intersection(w, segment(B,C))
parallelogram(B,P,T,Q)
T on circumcircle(A,B,C)

DETERMINE: distance(B,T) / distance(B,M)
</pre></div>


<p>Note that I also have a parser for that, so I can tell the types of the objects, possibly convert it to other format, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I agree that these are big challenges. One approach might be to have a DSL for geometric processes, and then to encode the windmill process as a program in the DSL. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>windmill(S, s, l) =
  while true:
    l \gets rotateUntil(l, s, CLOCK_WISE, fun l =&gt; exists s&#39; \in S, s \neq s&#39; /\ on(s&#39;, l))
    s \gets choose({s&#39; \in S : s&#39; \neq s /\ on(s&#39;, l)})
</pre></div>


<p>Here it would be provable that the <code>{s' \in S : ...}</code> set always has exactly one element (since by assumption |S| &gt; 1 and no three points are collinear) and thus the process is deterministic. The key insight required to solve the problem could then be cast as discovering an invariant of the program.</p>
<p>I am not sure what kind of semantics such a hypothetical DSL would warrant, probably operational, and bottoming out into some geometric object parameterized by time. I am also not sure whether we would have already had such abstractions before the windmill year, or whether the abstractions we can build now will be good enough for future problems.</p>

<p>Well, putting a human into the loop is fine, it just rather postpones the problem than solves it (but it may be a good thing to postpone it). I also like the idea of whitelist of allowed operations for every individual problem where the problems available so far would help us prepare templates for such whitelists. But if a problem requiring something more complex emerged, we could simply modify the whitelist to allow what is necessary without providing much hints (it is actually also putting a human to the loop but to another place).</p>
