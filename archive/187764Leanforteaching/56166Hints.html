<p>Hi, I think about proposing a Lean based course at University of Toronto, and I have a lot of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What can be covered in one semester?</li>
<li>How an exam can look like? Rules say that the student must earn large part of their grades in supervised settings to prevent cheating, so take home exam "formalize the following proofs" is not an option.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can you have a project based exam? Some of our courses at Imperial have this</p>

<p>I think a course like this, based on learning Lean, would do better with a final project instead of a final exam. However, if you still need a final exam, you could do a paper one based on type theory + whatever mathematics you cover</p>

<p>From the courses I have seen in CS departments, roughly half the semester is spent getting to grips with the type theory and formal proving, and the other half diving into some topic to be investigated using the tool. Software Foundations might be a good guidebook for the front half of the course, but suitably translated into Lean...</p>

<p>I was thinking about a mathematician oriented course with as little type theory as possible.</p>

<p>I'll reread the rules next week to see if we can have a final project.</p>
