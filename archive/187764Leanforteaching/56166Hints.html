<p>Hi, I think about proposing a Lean based course at University of Toronto, and I have a lot of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What can be covered in one semester?</li>
<li>How an exam can look like? Rules say that the student must earn large part of their grades in supervised settings to prevent cheating, so take home exam "formalize the following proofs" is not an option.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can you have a project based exam? Some of our courses at Imperial have this</p>
