<p>I just played the first two levels. Some remarks about design:<br>

<p>What is this huge white gap at the bottom of my proof? It's constantly there, and feels weird.</p>

<p>The tick mark left of "Lemma" feels weird before the lemma is proven.</p>

<p>You really need some postprocessing of the state window. The most important is that displaying information on <code>refl</code> is very distracting. The line numbers refer to nothing meaningful to the player. Syntax highlighting is missing. The upper right switch is irrelevant.</p>

<p>When proving, the red squiggle under the last character which simply indicates the proof is not finished is very confusing.</p>

<p>When navigating from page to page, the browser remembers the proofs, but still displays "Click to prove", hiding the proof.</p>

<p>Mohammad -- the undergraduates also have some feedback about this game. I have some notes in my office -- we should maybe meet on Monday. It's just about playable but we should make some minor changes before I start banging on about it on Twitter. In my mind one big question is whether we should make it all very beautiful -- but this is something that I am incapable of doing and which might take forever. Another big question is how this compares to the approach which <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> was taking using Observable. I know that Patrick feels like proving things about natural numbers is hellishly boring, but it's actually what we're teaching the undergraduates at Imperial right now so I thought it was worth pushing on with this.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of levels which aren't pushed. By the way, Mohammad's code which made the website from the Lean code is here <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker">https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker</a> and the Lean code which we used is here <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game">https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game</a> although I made some local modifications which I didn't push because I got confused about if I could fork his fork of my project :-)</p>
