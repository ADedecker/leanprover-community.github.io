<p>I've just read the fabulous "Mathematician's lament" again: <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a><br>
The author strongly makes the point that every mathematician is well aware of: a proof tells a story, it should explain an idea. The "formal" proofs of high school geometry are typically the only places where students are exposed to discovering proofs, as opposed to mere rote computations. The author asserts that formal proofs have their place. They should be used whenever there is a crisis, whenever there is a paradox, when our intuition doesn't suffice.<br>
In particular, students should first do lots of freestyle exploration before being exposed to formal proofs.</p>
<p>I think I agree with most of what the author says. Given the current state of our high school curricula, this means that we get freshmen at university that don't know what maths is about, and that don't know what a proof is supposed to be.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that I find it extremely annoying to grade Linear Algebra exams that are full of sentences that don't typecheck. Coming from that angle, it is very natural to teach students Lean in their first semester, so that at least they are aware of what it means to prove something, and to write down meaningful formulas.</p>
<p>On the other hand (and I had not yet appreciated this so much before) the author claims that these students are in fact not yet ripe for formal proofs. They should first learn to play and run and leap and fall and scramble and climb in the world of mathematics before destroying the proofs by formalised accounts of their adventures.</p>
<p>I'm quite curious about your opinions on these issues.</p>
