<p>Last semester I offer a course using the Avigad book Logic and Proofs. Now the students are asking for a course going deeper in Logics, Theorem Proving and Lean foundations, I possibility is to follow the <code>Theorem Prover in Lean</code>. Any other idea? What would the next steps for students that got interested in dependent types and ITP?</p>
