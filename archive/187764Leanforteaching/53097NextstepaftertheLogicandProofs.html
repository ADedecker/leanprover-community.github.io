<p>Last semester I offer a course using the Avigad book Logic and Proofs. Now the students are asking for a course going deeper in Logics, Theorem Proving and Lean foundations, I possibility is to follow the <code>Theorem Prover in Lean</code>. Any other idea? What would the next steps for students that got interested in dependent types and ITP?</p>

<p>I used Lean in some of my standard maths undergraduate introduction to proof course and it was quite chaotic. Some stuff like functions and equivalence relations go really nicely, except for when you need to explicitly invoke the axiom of choice (e.g. splitting a surjection) -- but I think we have a tactic <code>choose</code> for that now. But a lot of stuff using e.g. the real numbers is very hard for students, because they don't know their way around the library, and <em>everything</em> is hard, e.g. they want transitivity of <code>&lt;</code>, they just don't know where to look. They want distributivity of multiplication over addition -- they don't know what it's called. They want to prove 2 + 2 = 4 -- again they're stuck. </p>
<p>Maybe it would be interesting just to develop a course here on Zulip just teaching the absolute basics of the real numbers. Explain the "mathematician's interface" to the real numbers and document it in a way mathematicians can read. If you put the documentation in a good order then this can be part of the teaching materials. Then just give lots of basic questions about the real numbers in Lean, but introducing things in an order which is natural for Lean, not the random order which is chosen in the maths books. This is always the problem I am having -- mathematicians write books and give lectures in a way which can be difficult to literally translate into Lean. But one can imagine going for a beginnings of analysis course, where all the homework is formalised but the material goes through precisely which lemmas and tactics will be useful for solving the problems. One could start off just showing them how to do basic arithmetic in Lean like a goal of $3^2+4&gt;7$, then show them how to prove basic stuff which they know from school like (x+y)/z=x/z+y/z -- that is not going to be a triviality because z=0 must be dealt with and probably <code>ring</code> isn't going to do it because there's division. Once the students have learnt the basics of how to use the reals as an ordered field <em>then</em> they can start on doing the basic theory of sequences and series. You could target, for example, the sandwich theorem as "a main theorem of the course". </p>

<p>A decent 2nd year maths undergraduate at my university should be able to give you a proof of that theorem on a whiteboard. Why not teach your students to be able to give you a 21st century proof?</p>

<p>It is really annoying that <a href="http://leanprover.github.io" target="_blank" title="http://leanprover.github.io">leanprover.github.io</a> does not have linarith. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span> can you make me a standard Lean 3.4.2 + current mathlib server so people can try doing the questions online without having to install Lean?</p>
