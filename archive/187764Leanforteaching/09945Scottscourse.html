<p>Attempting to prepare examples for my students was getting discouraging. Also they are already upset about not being able to find lemmas. :-)</p>

<p>What are you trying to teach?</p>

<p>I'm teaching a "special topics" course in our department (a nice Australian fellowship frees me from normal teaching duties for a while). We have 12 students, and we're ... trying to learn Lean. :-)</p>

<p>In fact, we are all hanging out here on Zulip, but we have a secret channel just for us. :-)</p>

<p>Ok, this is very different from what I'm doing. I may have put it in the wrong stream. This is really teaching Lean, not Lean for teaching</p>

<p>I guess I'm less confident than you guys about Lean being ready for our mainstream courses (or rather, our mainstream courses being ready for Lean).</p>

<p>But I'm very very happy about the literate Lean programming tools you're building for pedagogical purposes.</p>

<p>Patrick,</p>
<p>What are you doing? FWIW, our aim isn't to teach Lean, per se, but to teach logic, proof, set theory, etc. Rather that a paper-pencil course using basic predicate logic and human checkers, we figured we'd teach them (they're early CS students) a more computational approach to logic, proof, checking, set theory (at least parts of it in Lean), etc. So it's Lean for teaching (discrete math), with teaching Lean as a necessary component.</p>

<p>Many of my early undergraduate students last semester (the first time we taught this) found it fairly rough going. One of the key points of friction is that students largely want to know how to get useful stuff done, and they don't see that learning DM using Lean, or that learning Lean, is going to help them in that regard. If they could just take a Javascript course, they'd be happy.</p>
