<p>What are you trying to teach?</p>

<p>I'm teaching a "special topics" course in our department (a nice Australian fellowship frees me from normal teaching duties for a while). We have 12 students, and we're ... trying to learn Lean. :-)</p>

<p>Here's assignment 1, which they are busy with at the moment: <a href="https://tqft.net/web/teaching/2019/ITP/assignment1.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://tqft.net/web/teaching/2019/ITP/assignment1.pdf">https://tqft.net/web/teaching/2019/ITP/assignment1.pdf</a></p>

<p>In fact, we are all hanging out here on Zulip, but we have a secret channel just for us. :-)</p>

<p>Ok, this is very different from what I'm doing. I may have put it in the wrong stream. This is really teaching Lean, not Lean for teaching</p>

<p>I guess I'm less confident than you guys about Lean being ready for our mainstream courses (or rather, our mainstream courses being ready for Lean).</p>

<p>But I'm very very happy about the literate Lean programming tools you're building for pedagogical purposes.</p>
