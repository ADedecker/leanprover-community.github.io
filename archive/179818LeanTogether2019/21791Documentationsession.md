<p>Could someone please post a short summary of the topic session on documentation?</p>

<p>I missed it so would also welcome any notes.</p>
<p>Also, it would be great to have something like "clojuredocs" for lean:<br>
e.g. <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff" target="_blank" title="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff">https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff</a></p>
