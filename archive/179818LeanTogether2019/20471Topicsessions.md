Maybe we could already gather extra suggestions for the topic sessions on Thursday and Friday. I have one: the end of Patrick's talk :stuck_out_tongue_wink:

Aah, so that is where I get to talk?

That would be the next topic session

since topic sessions last only one hour

Jeremy is your session chair. Johan, you can ask him to drag Patrick off the stage if he isn't done in 45 minutes.

But I think we actually did put the perfectoid spaces project as a suggested discussion topic, so you guys are in luck.

We're supposed to give a 90 minute talk together, in peace and harmony. This means that Patrick will do the talking, while I'll be the clown :clown:

@**Cyril Cohen** and myself are proposing an extra suggestion: the end of Assia's talk. The proposal is to give an introduction to 2 ingredients of the mathcomp library that could be of interest for mathlib too: small scale reflection (how to take the most of conversion when defining concepts) and unification hints (in particular how to implement instance inference with bundled structures).

I'm fine with using the beginning of the Lean 4 discussion slot (first slot on Thursday) for this, then following up with a discussion on why or why not we should do this in Lean 4, then discuss all the other feelings people have about Lean 4

 Wonderful, many thanks @**Sebastian Ullrich** ! Of course not hesitate to chair the session firmly so that there is enough time left for the other important items of the Lean 4 topic.
