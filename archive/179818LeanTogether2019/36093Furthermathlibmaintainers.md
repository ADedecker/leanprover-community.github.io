### [Further mathlib maintainers](36093Furthermathlibmaintainers.html)

Quick thought: One of the suggested topics is “Further mathlib maintainers”. I suggest having this discussion as early as possible, so that we can reap potential benefits during the remainder of the workshop, and so that there is the possibility of live apprenticeship.

It will be easy enough to shift these discussions around later. We can talk on Monday.

Which organisation would fund post docs whose job it was to help maintain mathlib? Would MS?

Because of this issue I've been enquiring around potential sources of funding in the UK but no luck yet
