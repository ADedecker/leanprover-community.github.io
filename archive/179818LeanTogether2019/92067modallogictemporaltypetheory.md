<p>These talks reminded me of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10258</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book introduces a temporal type theory, the first of its kind as far as we know. It is based on a standard core, and as such it can be formalized in a proof assistant such as Coq or Lean by adding a number of axioms.</p>
