### [references for surface diagrams?](99706referencesforsurfacediagrams.html)

#### [Zans Mihejevs (Jan 11 2019 at 14:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/references for surface diagrams?/near/154916195):
would anyone have recommendations for an intro text on surface diagrams? i'm familiar with string diagrams for monoidal categories / proof nets for linear logic, and I'd like to see a generalisation to a higher category setting
