There have been a number of future workshops and conferences advertised during this one. Here's a running list:
Free Computational Mathematics (Feb 11, Luminy): https://opendreamkit.org/2019/02/11/FreeComputationalMathematicsConference/
AITP 2019 (April 7, Obergurgl) : http://aitp-conference.org/2019/
CICM 2019 (July 8, Prague): https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php
Tom Hales mentioned a Lean- and/or Formal Abstracts-related meeting in Vietnam in June 2019.

Ursula Martin told me about a follow-up to the 2017 Newton Institute Big Proof workshop. It's at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in  Edinburgh.   "The meeting will run from mid-day on Monday 27th May 2019  to mid-day on Friday 31 May 2019, with a focus on computer-aided proof for mathematics, in particular pragmatic foundations, social processes, and exchange formats. " 

I don't know if there's a web page yet.

 There is a webpage: https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html - like most ICMS things the event is by invitation; many here will be invited already, and the "informal enquiries" will definitely be followed up on.  But there is a limited capacity for the space.
