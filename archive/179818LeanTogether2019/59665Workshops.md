<p>There have been a number of future workshops and conferences advertised during this one. Here's a running list:<br>
Free Computational Mathematics (Feb 11, Luminy): <a href="https://opendreamkit.org/2019/02/11/FreeComputationalMathematicsConference/" target="_blank" title="https://opendreamkit.org/2019/02/11/FreeComputationalMathematicsConference/">https://opendreamkit.org/2019/02/11/FreeComputationalMathematicsConference/</a><br>
AITP 2019 (April 7, Obergurgl) : <a href="http://aitp-conference.org/2019/" target="_blank" title="http://aitp-conference.org/2019/">http://aitp-conference.org/2019/</a><br>
CICM 2019 (July 8, Prague): <a href="https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php" target="_blank" title="https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php">https://www.cicm-conference.org/2019/cicm.php</a><br>

<p>Ursula Martin told me about a follow-up to the 2017 Newton Institute Big Proof workshop. It's at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in  Edinburgh.   "The meeting will run from mid-day on Monday 27th May 2019  to mid-day on Friday 31 May 2019, with a focus on computer-aided proof for mathematics, in particular pragmatic foundations, social processes, and exchange formats. " </p>
<p>I don't know if there's a web page yet.</p>

<p>There is a webpage: <a href="https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html" target="_blank" title="https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html">https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html</a> - like most ICMS things the event is by invitation; many here will be invited already, and the "informal enquiries" will definitely be followed up on.  But there is a limited capacity for the space.</p>
