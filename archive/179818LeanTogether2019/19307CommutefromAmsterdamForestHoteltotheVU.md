### [Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU](19307CommutefromAmsterdamForestHoteltotheVU.html)

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 04 2019 at 22:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154439635):
@**Patrick Massot** you asked on the main stream how to get to the VU.  I'm also staying at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel if you need assistance.  It takes about 15 minutes by bus (including waiting time and getting to the room at VU).  You can also walk to the VU, in summer it was a wonderful trip along Amstelveen's grachten; it takes about 30 minutes by foot.  If you intend to take public transport, I strongly recommend getting an OV chipkaart.

#### [Patrick Massot (Jan 04 2019 at 22:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154439724):
Thanks! I have an ankle strain so I will definitely take the bus

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 04 2019 at 22:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154440121):
On Monday I'll leave at 8:20, please feel free to join me.  (The breakfast will start at 7:00.)

#### [Patrick Massot (Jan 04 2019 at 22:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154440274):
I guess it means you'll walk?

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 04 2019 at 22:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154440413):
No, by bus.  If I wanted to walk, I'd need to leave by 8:00.  Maybe I'll walk another day.

#### [Patrick Massot (Jan 04 2019 at 22:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154440430):
then I'm confused. Or maybe you want to be there early because you talk first?

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 04 2019 at 22:58)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154440490):
Yes, exactly.

#### [Patrick Massot (Jan 04 2019 at 23:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154443220):
Ok, maybe the end of your breakfast won't be a long time after the beginning of mine then :wink:

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 04 2019 at 23:51)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154443861):
I suppose I won't be in a hurry on Monday morning. Though I also want to explore renting a bike on Monday.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 04 2019 at 23:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154444233):
FYI, Google's bus directions from the Forest Hotel look a little off. The bus stop on De Boelelaan is right by the front door of the main building, no need to walk in a loop around to the back.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 00:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154444305):
Sebastian, a lot of hotels here have bikes available, you could ask when you check in.

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 05 2019 at 00:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154444841):
Nice, I'll try that!

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 05 2019 at 00:35)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154446058):
It's 15€/day at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel.

 OV chipkaarts are a royal pain. But the only other option is that you hassle the bus drivers while all the other passengers give you a staredown worthy of a kickboxing champion.

This is not how you spell "most wonderful way to pay for public transport ever".  You just need to check in and check out and never worry about what line you take or which city you're in or how much you need to pay or how many zones it takes or whatever.  I'd love to have something like that in Vienna.

#### [Johan Commelin (Jan 05 2019 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154464220):
The system we had before that was way better.

#### [Johan Commelin (Jan 05 2019 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154464221):
It was the same thing you described, but without the "check in and check out".

#### [Johan Commelin (Jan 05 2019 at 09:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154464274):

Can I have some practical advice? I'll arrive at the airport and will then want to take public transport to a hotel and then throughout the week will want to move freely between the university, the hotel where many people are staying the hotel where I am staying, and the place we're eating on wed. I'm not going to do any sightseeing because I've been a million times before, but the schedule above will still involve a lot of trams and trains. What should I buy?

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154470948):
A bike, but if you insist on using the tram/metro, probably an OV-chipkaart. I think you can get unlimited passes for the metro/tram for various amounts of time, but these won't cover the train to/from Schiphol. So it's a question of whether buying the chipkaart + individual fares is more than the unlimited pass + airport trips.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154470959):
And if you buy the OV-chipkaart and don't lose it, you can use it for future trips.

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 13:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471194):
Oh I remember now. I never buy these. I just buy the paper tickets so I have to go to a different machine. I'm not biking :-) everyone is on the wrong side of the road!

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 13:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471241):
I don't care about $20 v $30, I'm claiming it all back!

#### [Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 13:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471242):
I want convenience :-)

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:12)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471299):
Where do you buy the chipkaart btw?

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471368):
I'd just buy the chipkaart at Schiphol and throw €30 on it. That way you don't need to bother with separate tickets for the train.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471371):
Minchao, you can get them at train stations and I think at supermarkets and other shops.

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471372):
There were GVB staff outside Schiphol selling travel tickets but I didn’t see an OV-chipkaart

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471416):
Ok I’ll try to find one tomorrow

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471425):
There's an Albert Heijn close to the Forest Hotel, they should be able to help you there.

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 05 2019 at 13:25)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471660):
At Schiphol you can get them from the vending machines.

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471779):
Thank you Rob and Gabriel! Gabriel, were you having breakfast this morning at the hotel? I think I saw a guy who looks like you...

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 05 2019 at 13:33)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154471887):
I was not really awake yet, but I think you left right after I sat down next to you.

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:37)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154472014):
Me either. Now I think you must be the guy! :grinning:

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 05 2019 at 17:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154478109):
Another point of caution: if you considered taking the Metro (M51) to VU, then please be aware that the station closest to the Amsterdam Forest Hotel (Kronenburg) is closed during the workshop.  You can take the bus from the station Graaf Florislaan (next to the hotel) instead.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 17:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154478230):
Ooh, good catch.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 17:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154478233):
It looks like there's a temporary stop nearby for the 5 tram, which runs the same route, but not for the metro.

#### [Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 17:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154478987):
I just bought a daily ticket at the station and saw the notice. It's closed starting Jan 7.

 That's a bit pricey. There's also https://black-bikes.com/bike/pedal-brake-bike/ next to the university, though it looks like one should book them 24h in advance.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 11:46)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154511297):
It's winter, there's no way they're renting all their bikes right now. I'm pretty confident you could walk in and get one without booking.

#### [Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 06 2019 at 11:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154511516):
Thanks. Fortunately I'm well-trained in cycling in these conditions.

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 11:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154511529):
I have arrived! I am staying at a hotel very close to the University. My room might not be ready for a while, but I will go for a run in the meanwhile. If anyone is up for dinner later, let me know when and where.

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 12:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154512671):
I am just around the corner from Black Bikes. Interestingly, the guy in the shop told me that they don't have any bikes right now, though they may have some later.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 12:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154513232):
Oh, oops...

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 12:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154513234):
I need to take care of some things this afternoon, but might be up for dinner later!

#### [Kenny Lau (Jan 06 2019 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154513292):
when/where will the dinner be?

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 15:17)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154517843):
@**Rob Lewis** Sounds good. Just let me know. I can get a bike from the hotel for the evening, so I can go anywhere.
@**Kenny Lau** We are still waiting for a proposal. This is close to the Forest Hotel, where some people are staying: https://deveranda.nl/brasserie. But I wouldn't mind doing something more touristy near the city center.

#### [Jesse Michael Han (Jan 06 2019 at 15:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518170):
I have also arrived! I'm at The Alfred Hotel, towards the city center.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 15:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518372):
There's a light festival along the canals right now. In particular, tonight is the last night the botanical gardens will be lit. They're open until 10pm, I was thinking of going later.

#### [Johannes Hölzl (Jan 06 2019 at 15:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518383):
I thought about going there too

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 15:34)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518384):
I want to finish my slides tonight, so dinner is iffy. But whether or not I make it to dinner, you're welcome to join me there if you want.

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 15:36)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518445):
That sounds nice. I'd like to join you. I won't last much later than 10, but I'll be good until then. Just let me know where to meet you.
@Jesse, you are near Vondelpark, which is a very nice park, worth walking around.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 15:47)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154518759):
How about this? Let's assume I won't make it to dinner, and plan to meet at the entrance around 8:30. Is that too late for you?

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 16:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519112):
That sounds great. Is it the botanical garden zuidas, right across from the university?

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 16:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519152):
Oh, and what are the tipping conventions here?

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 16:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519207):
Oh, no, this one: https://www.dehortus.nl/

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 16:03)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519209):
Round up for convenience if you want, but nothing's expected.

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 16:08)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519370):
Got it. I'll rent a bike, wander around downtown, get some dinner there, and meet you at the gardens at 8:30. I don't have a working phone here, though I may find a place with wifi. But, anyhow, if something goes wrong and we don't find each other, don't worry about it too much.

#### [Rob Lewis (Jan 06 2019 at 16:19)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154519765):
Sounds good! I guess there are multiple entrances, let's say the one by the Hortusbrug.

#### [Jeremy Avigad (Jan 06 2019 at 16:29)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154520064):
I see it on the map. And I have inferred that "brug" = "bridge". Later I will ask you tutor me on how to pronounce all these funny looking words and names.

#### [Gabriel Ebner (Jan 06 2019 at 16:31)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154520141):
There is just one entrance, and it's near de Hortusbrug.

#### [Kenny Lau (Jan 06 2019 at 17:52)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean Together 2019/topic/Commute from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to the VU/near/154522623):
what are you guys doing instead of Lean

they're eating and sightseeing.

I've arrived at the Forest Hotel too. Meet at the bar?

I'm really tired, I think I'd rather sleep now and be a bit more fresh tomorrow :)

Okay, sure. Do you want to suggest a time for breakfast?

How about 8:00?

Works for me!

where?

At the hotel. I hope.

Yes, at least that's what I meant :grinning:
