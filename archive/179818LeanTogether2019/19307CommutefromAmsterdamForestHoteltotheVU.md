<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> you asked on the main stream how to get to the VU.  I'm also staying at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel if you need assistance.  It takes about 15 minutes by bus (including waiting time and getting to the room at VU).  You can also walk to the VU, in summer it was a wonderful trip along Amstelveen's grachten; it takes about 30 minutes by foot.  If you intend to take public transport, I strongly recommend getting an OV chipkaart.</p>

<p>Thanks! I have an ankle strain so I will definitely take the bus</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jan 04 2019 at 22:53)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154440121):
<p>On Monday I'll leave at 8:20, please feel free to join me.  (The breakfast will start at 7:00.)</p>

<p>I guess it means you'll walk?</p>

<p>No, by bus.  If I wanted to walk, I'd need to leave by 8:00.  Maybe I'll walk another day.</p>

#### [ Patrick Massot (Jan 04 2019 at 22:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154440430):
<p>then I'm confused. Or maybe you want to be there early because you talk first?</p>

<p>Yes, exactly.</p>

<p>I suppose I won't be in a hurry on Monday morning. Though I also want to explore renting a bike on Monday.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 04 2019 at 23:59)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154444233):
<p>FYI, Google's bus directions from the Forest Hotel look a little off. The bus stop on De Boelelaan is right by the front door of the main building, no need to walk in a loop around to the back.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 00:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154444305):
<p>Sebastian, a lot of hotels here have bikes available, you could ask when you check in.</p>

#### [ Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 05 2019 at 00:11)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154444841):
<p>Nice, I'll try that!</p>

<p>It's 15€/day at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel.</p>

<p>OV chipkaarts are a royal pain. But the only other option is that you hassle the bus drivers while all the other passengers give you a staredown worthy of a kickboxing champion.</p>

#### [ Gabriel Ebner (Jan 05 2019 at 08:32)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154462880):
<blockquote>

<p>This is not how you spell "most wonderful way to pay for public transport ever".  You just need to check in and check out and never worry about what line you take or which city you're in or how much you need to pay or how many zones it takes or whatever.  I'd love to have something like that in Vienna.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 05 2019 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154464220):
<p>The system we had before that was way better.</p>

#### [ Johan Commelin (Jan 05 2019 at 09:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154464221):
<p>It was the same thing you described, but without the "check in and check out".</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 12:54)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154470765):
<p>Can I have some practical advice? I'll arrive at the airport and will then want to take public transport to a hotel and then throughout the week will want to move freely between the university, the hotel where many people are staying the hotel where I am staying, and the place we're eating on wed. I'm not going to do any sightseeing because I've been a million times before, but the schedule above will still involve a lot of trams and trains. What should I buy?</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:00)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154470948):
<p>A bike, but if you insist on using the tram/metro, probably an OV-chipkaart. I think you can get unlimited passes for the metro/tram for various amounts of time, but these won't cover the train to/from Schiphol. So it's a question of whether buying the chipkaart + individual fares is more than the unlimited pass + airport trips.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:01)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154470959):
<p>And if you buy the OV-chipkaart and don't lose it, you can use it for future trips.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 13:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154471194):
<p>Oh I remember now. I never buy these. I just buy the paper tickets so I have to go to a different machine. I'm not biking :-) everyone is on the wrong side of the road!</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jan 05 2019 at 13:10)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154471241):
<p>I don't care about $20 v $30, I'm claiming it all back!</p>

<p>I want convenience :-)</p>

<p>Where do you buy the chipkaart btw?</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154471368):
<p>I'd just buy the chipkaart at Schiphol and throw €30 on it. That way you don't need to bother with separate tickets for the train.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 13:15)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154471371):
<p>Minchao, you can get them at train stations and I think at supermarkets and other shops.</p>

<p>There were GVB staff outside Schiphol selling travel tickets but I didn’t see an OV-chipkaart</p>

#### [ Minchao Wu (Jan 05 2019 at 13:16)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154471416):
<p>Ok I’ll try to find one tomorrow</p>

<p>There's an Albert Heijn close to the Forest Hotel, they should be able to help you there.</p>

<p>At Schiphol you can get them from the vending machines.</p>

<p>Thank you Rob and Gabriel! Gabriel, were you having breakfast this morning at the hotel? I think I saw a guy who looks like you...</p>

<p>Another point of caution: if you considered taking the Metro (M51) to VU, then please be aware that the station closest to the Amsterdam Forest Hotel (Kronenburg) is closed during the workshop.  You can take the bus from the station Graaf Florislaan (next to the hotel) instead.</p>

#### [ Rob Lewis (Jan 05 2019 at 17:09)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Commute%20from%20Amsterdam%20Forest%20Hotel%20to%20the%20VU/near/154478230):

<p>It looks like there's a temporary stop nearby for the 5 tram, which runs the same route, but not for the metro.</p>

<p>I just bought a daily ticket at the station and saw the notice. It's closed starting Jan 7.</p>

<p>It's winter, there's no way they're renting all their bikes right now. I'm pretty confident you could walk in and get one without booking.</p>

<p>Round up for convenience if you want, but nothing's expected.</p>

<p>Got it. I'll rent a bike, wander around downtown, get some dinner there, and meet you at the gardens at 8:30. I don't have a working phone here, though I may find a place with wifi. But, anyhow, if something goes wrong and we don't find each other, don't worry about it too much.</p>

<p>Sounds good! I guess there are multiple entrances, let's say the one by the Hortusbrug.</p>

<p>I see it on the map. And I have inferred that "brug" = "bridge". Later I will ask you tutor me on how to pronounce all these funny looking words and names.</p>

<p>There is just one entrance, and it's near de Hortusbrug.</p>
