Videos of the lectures will be available here: https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/#videos
Of course, the university A/V people are having trouble setting up the streaming. It will be working eventually. Hopefully before this afternoon.

Will there be videos of just the lectures or the tutorial sessions as well?

If anyone is watching the stream/videos: is the sound from questions being captured?

I was trying to watch the stream but it wouldn't load.

But I didn't try after your message that it was fixed.
I'll try again tomorrow!

Were the talks recorded?

You could try right now.

The morning wasn't streamed because the A/V people were struggling with the internet. It was recorded but I don't think they've uploaded it.

The current session is streaming.

Sound's coming through loud and clear. Will report on audience questions when they happen :grinning:

Can't really hear audience questions - Mario's was fairly clear, probably because he was sitting closest to the mike.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 07 2019 at 17:39)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/154581992):
Can we have the speaker repeat the audience questions, if possible?

Is the stream active?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Jan 08 2019 at 14:06)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/154642864):
By request of the speaker, this talk isn't being recorded.

Assia Mahboubi's talk at 4:00pm will not be recorded either.

Right now the videos are streaming from the VU A/V department's site. @**Kevin Buzzard**  had asked me about getting copies of the videos for teaching purposes. They would also be nice to archive. The A/V people just quoted me €35 to send the video files... anyone have a clever idea how to extract the video from the stream instead?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Kevin Buzzard (Jan 14 2019 at 18:18)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/155099683):
Hah! I don't need copies of the videos, I have been talking to some A/V people here and we're going to make something better; being able to access the videos like I can now currently do, is fine for me.

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Jan 14 2019 at 18:20)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/155099839):
I mean, I'd like the videos, if only for insurance against them disappearing from the university servers. But €35 seems steep!

Presumably you're going to bill him €35 for this information.

30€, mates' rates

Thanks for the links, Sebastian. I'm able to stream the video using VLC, but for some reason it doesn't pick up the audio tracks, and the Audio Track submenu in the Audio menu is grayed out

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Amin Bandali (Jan 14 2019 at 21:21)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/155113361):
Any thoughts?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Jan 14 2019 at 21:57)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/155117505):
How about €30 worth of beer next time you're in Amsterdam?

I had the same issue with VLC. If you append (format=mpd-isoff) to Sebastian's URLs, you get the audio as well. For example: https://av-stream.vu.nl/MediasiteDeliver/AVC/SSVideo/27894c3a-8a4d-4768-a042-1f62e5345a6c/30f3dac8-9226-4b73-8da5-2ecec7d24e43.ism/manifest(format=mpd-isoff)

@**Rob Lewis** Isn't €30 worth of beer one sad shooter of beer in Amsterdam?

#### [![Click to go to Zulip](../../assets/img/zulip2.png) Rob Lewis (Jan 15 2019 at 00:27)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Videos/near/155129028):
Maybe two sad shooters or one okay bottle.
