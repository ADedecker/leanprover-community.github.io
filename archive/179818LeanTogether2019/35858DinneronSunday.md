So, who would like to meet up for dinner?  Jeremy suggested https://deveranda.nl/ in the other topic.  Since everybody seems to be heading to de Hortus afterwards, how about something more in the center?  Yesterday we saw a nice Indonesian place: http://www.restaurantdesa.com/

sounds good to me

I'm gonna skip dinner, but I'll see you all at de Hortus, or tomorrow morning!

Ok, so how about 19:30 at Dèsa?  It takes about 30 minutes from Amsterdam Forest Hotel to Dèsa and 20 minutes from Dèsa to de Hortus.

Chris and I have arrived at Schiphol

where should we go?

You've probably missed dinner with Gabriel and Mario. We're meeting at https://www.dehortus.nl/ in 30 min to walk around the light show. But they close at 10, won't be a lot of time if you go to the hotel first.

I just got some fries from Frietfabrik, close to the Forest Hotel. Definitely recommendable, if you want something to take away...
