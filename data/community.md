# Meet the community

The Lean community is rather diverse. We have users coming from computer
science as well as mathematics, and even a couple of people with a
physics background.
Most users are either students or work in academia, but there also some
data scientists and software engineers working in industry.

## The Lean Zulip chat

The main gathering point of our community is a 
[Zulip chat instance](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com). 
Since this chatroom is only visible to registered users, we provide an 
[openly accessible archive](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/)
of the public discussions. 
This is useful for quick reference; for a better browsing interface, 
and to participate in the discussions, we strongly suggest joining the chat.
Registering with your real name is preferred, but not required. 
Starting by briefly introducing youself is also appreciated.

Questions from users at all levels of expertise are welcomed. 
Asking your first questions in the *new members* stream will ensure the answers
won't asssume you know much about Lean. But you are welcome to use more specialized streams.
Please start new discussion topics rather than using unrelated existing topics.
If you need coding help, you may be asked to provide a [MWE](mwe.html).
Also beware of [XY problems](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem): try to give enough context.

To post a snippet of code inline, enclose it in single backticks: `` `my code here` ``. 
If your code contains backticks itself, enclose it in more backticks than it contains: 
``` `` my`code`contains`backticks `` ```.

Longer snippets should be enclosed between two lines containing three back-quotes, as in:
````
```
def my_nat : n := 5
#check my_nat
```
````

You can use LaTeX using `$$` to enclose inline LaTeX and 
````
```latex
my LaTeX code here
```
````

for displayed math.

## GitHub

The next gathering point after Zulip is GitHub, which hosts all the
[community repositories](https://github.com/leanprover-community).
In particular, the 
[mathlib pull requests](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls) 
page is the right place to see our ongoing efforts.

If you want to participate in our projects then you can read our
[contributing guide](contribute/index.html).

## Workshops and conferences

In addition to general formal methods conferences such as CPP and ITP,
the Lean community gathers at specific events. 
The largest past events were:

* [FoMM 2020](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/)
* [Lean together 2019](https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/)
