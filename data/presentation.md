## Lean and its Mathematical Library

The [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io)
is a proof assistant developed principally by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.

The Lean mathematical library, *mathlib*, is a community-driven effort
to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the
Lean proof assistant. The library also contains definitions
useful for programming. This project is very active, with many
regular contributors and daily activity.

The contents, design, and community organization of mathlib are
described in the paper
[The Lean mathematical library](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09336), which appeared
at CPP 2020. You can get a bird's eye view of what is in the library by
reading [the library overview](mathlib-overview.html).
You can also have a look at our [repository statistics](mathlib_stats.html)
to see how it grows and who contributes to it.
