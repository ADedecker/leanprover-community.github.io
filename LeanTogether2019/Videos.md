#### Rob Lewis (Jan 07 2019 at 16:51):
The morning wasn't streamed because the A/V people were struggling with the internet. It was recorded but I don't think they've uploaded it.

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 07 2019 at 16:51):
The current session is streaming.

#### Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 07 2019 at 16:56):
Sound's coming through loud and clear. Will report on audience questions when they happen :grinning:

#### Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 07 2019 at 17:13):
Can't really hear audience questions - Mario's was fairly clear, probably because he was sitting closest to the mike.

#### Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 07 2019 at 17:39):
Can we have the speaker repeat the audience questions, if possible?

#### Koundinya Vajjha (Jan 08 2019 at 14:05):
Is the stream active?

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 08 2019 at 14:06):
By request of the speaker, this talk isn't being recorded.

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 08 2019 at 14:20):
Assia Mahboubi's talk at 4:00pm will not be recorded either.

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 14 2019 at 18:17):
Right now the videos are streaming from the VU A/V department's site. @**Kevin Buzzard**  had asked me about getting copies of the videos for teaching purposes. They would also be nice to archive. The A/V people just quoted me €35 to send the video files... anyone have a clever idea how to extract the video from the stream instead?

#### Kevin Buzzard (Jan 14 2019 at 18:18):
Hah! I don't need copies of the videos, I have been talking to some A/V people here and we're going to make something better; being able to access the videos like I can now currently do, is fine for me.

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 14 2019 at 18:20):
I mean, I'd like the videos, if only for insurance against them disappearing from the university servers. But €35 seems steep!

#### Kevin Buzzard (Jan 14 2019 at 18:36):
Presumably you're going to bill him €35 for this information.

#### Sebastian Ullrich (Jan 14 2019 at 18:39):
30€, mates' rates

#### Amin Bandali (Jan 14 2019 at 21:21):
Thanks for the links, Sebastian. I'm able to stream the video using VLC, but for some reason it doesn't pick up the audio tracks, and the Audio Track submenu in the Audio menu is grayed out

#### Amin Bandali (Jan 14 2019 at 21:21):
Any thoughts?

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 14 2019 at 21:57):
How about €30 worth of beer next time you're in Amsterdam?

#### William Whistler (Jan 14 2019 at 22:03):
I had the same issue with VLC. If you append (format=mpd-isoff) to Sebastian's URLs, you get the audio as well. For example: https://av-stream.vu.nl/MediasiteDeliver/AVC/SSVideo/27894c3a-8a4d-4768-a042-1f62e5345a6c/30f3dac8-9226-4b73-8da5-2ecec7d24e43.ism/manifest(format=mpd-isoff)

#### Simon Hudon (Jan 14 2019 at 23:47):
@**Rob Lewis** Isn't €30 worth of beer one sad shooter of beer in Amsterdam?

#### Rob Lewis (Jan 15 2019 at 00:27):
Maybe two sad shooters or one okay bottle.
