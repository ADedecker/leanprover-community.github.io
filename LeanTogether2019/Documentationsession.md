## [Lean Together 2019](index.html)
### [Documentation session](Documentationsession.html)

#### Johan Commelin (Jan 11 2019 at 13:51):
Could someone please post a short summary of the topic session on documentation?

#### Joseph Corneli (Jan 16 2019 at 12:41):
I missed it so would also welcome any notes.

Also, it would be great to have something like "clojuredocs" for lean:
e.g. https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff
