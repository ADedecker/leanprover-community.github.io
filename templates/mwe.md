# Minimal working examples

A minimum working example is a code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted and still have the same features (working) and that does not include unnecessary details (minimum).

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is the stackoverflow guide to making MWEs.

Please make sure that your code snippet has:

- correct imports; and
- all the relevant definitions / theorems.

In particular, you should *test* this by making a new Lean file, pasting your code snippet into it, and seeing if you get the expected behavior. This is exactly what people who try to help you will do!

If you post a code snippet on Zulip, please make sure it is surrounded in triple backticks.

````text
```
def my_nat : nat := 5
```
````
